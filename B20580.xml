            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:206267:12"/>contributed as Adventurers, in raiſing a far more conſiderable Joynt-Stock, than any was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver before rais'd in this Kingdom, for any Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Undertaking or Project of Trade whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, which makes it now of ſo much the more U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal a Concern to the Nation.</p>
                  <p>And for the better Enabling us to Accompliſh the Ends of Your Majeſties ſaid Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Letters Patent, we have, in Purſuance thereunto, appointed certain Deputees of our own Number, to Tranſact and Negotiat our neceſſary Affairs beyond Sea. And at the ſame time, to Treat with ſuch Forreigners of any Nation in Amity with Your Majeſty, as might be inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Joyn with us for the Purpoſes aforeſaid.</p>
                  <p>In the Proſecution of which Commiſſion to our ſaid Deputees, (Veſted with full Power and Authority according to Law) we are not a little ſurpriz'd to find, to the great Hindrance and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of our Affairs, That Your Majeſties En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy to the Courts of <hi>Lunenburgh,</hi> and Reſident at <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> have, under Pretence of ſpecial War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant from Your Majeſty, given in a Joint-Subſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed Memorial to the Senate of <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> expreſly Invading the Priviledges granted to our Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, by your Majeſty's ſaid Acts of Parliament and Letsers Patent, as by the herewith tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted Copy may appear.</p>
                  <p>By the which <hi>Memorial</hi> we ſuſtain great and manifeſt Prejudices, fince both the Senate and Inhabitants of the ſaid City of <hi>Hamburgh</hi> are thereby (contrary to the Law of Nations) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly threatned with your Majeſty's high Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, if they, or either of them, ſhould coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance or joyn with us, in any Treaty of Trade

We have in purſuance and upon the publick Faith thereof, not only contributed at home a far more conſiderable Joint-Stock than was ever before raiſed in this Nation, for any pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Undertaking or Project of Trade whatſoever; but have alſo had all the promiſing Hopes and Proſpect of Foreign Aid that our Hearts could wiſh, till, to our great Surprize, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:206267:16"/>at <hi>Hamburgh</hi> have, under Pretence of Special Warrant from his Majeſty, put a ſtop thereto, by giving in a Memorial to the Senate of that City, threatning both Senate and Inhabitants with the King's utmoſt Diſpleaſure, if they ſhould counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance or joyn with us in any Treaty of Trade or Commerce: As by the annexed Copy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of may appear.</p>
               <p>Upon due Conſideration whereof, we have, in all Duty and Humility, addreſs'd His Majeſty in <hi>June</hi> laſt for Redreſs thereof.</p>
               <p>In anſwer to which Addreſs His Majeſty was then graciouſly pleaſed to ſignifie by his Royal Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>That upon His return into</hi> England, <hi>He would take into Conſideration the Contents of our ſaid Addreſs. And that in the mean time He would give Orders to His ſaid Miniſters at</hi> Hamburgh, <hi>not to make uſe of His Royal Name or Authorty for obſtructing the Trade of our Company with the Inhabitants of that City.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the full Aſſurance of which we reſted ſecure, and took our Meaſures accordingly, till to our further Surprize and unſpeakable Prejudice, we found by repeated Advices from <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> that the ſaid Reſident continues ſtill Contumaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and is ſo far from giving due obedience to His Majeſty's ſaid Order, that upon Application made to him by our Agent in that City, with all the Reſpect due to his Character, he declared, <hi>That as yet he had got no ſuch Order on our behalf</hi> Which, by a further Addreſs we are now to lay: before His Majeſty.</p>
               <p>But whereas we humbly conceive your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips to be more immediatly, under His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, the Guardians of the Laws and Liberties of this Kingdom, we think it our Duty to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:206267:17"/>to your Lordſhips the Conſequences of the ſaid Memorial, both with relation to our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany in particular, and the Priviledges, Intereſt, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Dignity and Reputation of the Nation in general.</p>
               <p>Your Lordſhips very well know of what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the Succeſs of this Company is to the whole Kingdom, and that ſcarce any particular Society or Corporation within the ſame can juſtly boaſt of ſo unanimous a Suffrage or Sanction, as the Acts of Parliament, by which this Company is eſtabliſhed: So that if effectual meaſures be not taken for putting an early ſtop to ſuch an open and violent Infringement of, and Encroachment upon the Priviledges of ſo ſolemn a Conſtitution, 'tis hard to gueſs how far it may in after Ages, be made uſe of as a Precedent for invading and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning even the very Fundamental Rights, Natural Liberties, &amp; indiſputable Independency of this Kingdom; which, by the now open and frequent Practiſes of our unkind Neighbours, ſeem to be too ſhreudly pointed at. And ſhould this Company (wherein the moſt conſiderable of the Nobility, Gentry, Merchants, and whole Body of the Royal Boroughs are concern'd) be ſo unhappy (which God forbid) as to have its Deſigns rendred unſucceſsful, through the unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable evil Treatments of our ſaid Neighbours; moſt certain it is, that no Conſideration whatever, can thereafter induce this Nation to join in any ſuch other Publick, tho' never ſo advantageous Undertaking, as not doubting but to meet with the like or greater Diſcouragements from thoſe who give ſuch frequent and manifeſt Indications of their Deſigns, to wreſt our Right and Freedom of Trade out of our Hands.</p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:206267:17"/>
               <p>For which cauſe we humbly offer the Premiſſes to your Lordſhip's ſerious Conſideration, not doubting but you will (in your profound Wiſdom and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence) take ſuch effectual Meaſures for Redreſs thereof at preſent, and to prevent the like. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments for the future, as may be capable to remove thoſe Apprehenſions and Jealouſies which the bare-faced and avowed Methods of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> do now ſuggeſt, not only to our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany in particular, but even to the whole Body of this Nation in general.</p>

                  <hi>The humble Petition of the Council-General of the Company of</hi> Scotland, <hi>Trading to</hi> Africa <hi>and the</hi> Indies.</head>
               <opener>Sheweth,</opener>
               <p>THat whereas the Wiſdom of the King, and this preſent Parliament, has thought fit by two ſeveral ſolemn Acts, and Letters Patent under the <hi>Great Seal</hi> of this <hi>Kingdom,</hi> to eſtabliſh our COMPANY, with ſuch <hi>Power, Priviledges,</hi> and <hi>Immunities,</hi> as were thought needful, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage any ſuch New Undertaking in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; particulary to raiſe a Joynt-Stock in ſuch manner as we ſhould think fit. And for that End, to enfranchiſe ſuch Foreigners, as would become Partners with us, and to enter into Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Commerce with any in Amity with His Majeſty for that effect, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thoſe of our Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber who were then intruſted with the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof, did think it moſt Natural to make the firſt Offer of ſharing our ſaid Priviledges, with
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:206267:19"/>our Country-Men and other Neighbours in <hi>England,</hi> as living under the ſame Monarchy. And they not only readily embraced the Offer, but in Nine Days time ſubſcribed 300000 <hi>l. Sterl.</hi> as the one half of the Capital-Stock then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and Actually payed in the firſt fourth part thereof, part in <hi>Specie,</hi> part in <hi>Bank-Notes,</hi> and the reſt in <hi>Notes</hi> payable upon demand.</p>
               <p>That both Houſes of the Parliament of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> taking Umbrage at thoſe Proceedings, did not only joyntly Addreſs His Majeſty, for fruſtrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ends of the ſaid Acts, but the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons did alſo appoint a Committee to Examine what Methods were taken, for obtaining the ſaid Acts of Parliament here for eſtabliſhing our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, who were the Subſcribers thereto, and who were the Promoters and Adviſers thereof; with Power to ſend for Perſons, Papers, and Records: Purſuant to which, the ſaid Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee gave Orders to Summon not only the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Subſcribers, but even ſome Perſons then Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiding in <hi>Scotland,</hi> as by the ſaid Addreſs, Votes of the Houſe of Commons, and Copy of the ſaid Summons may appear; By all which, together with ſome other Meaſures then taken, our Friends in <hi>England</hi> were, to our great Loſs, Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Retardment, forced to relinquiſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That notwithſtanding of that Diſcouragement, not only moſt of the Nobility, Gentry, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, and the whole Body of the Royal Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, have upon the Inducement, and Publick Faith of the ſaid Acts of Parliament, and Letters Patent, Contributed as Adventurers, in raiſing a far more conſiderable Joynt-Stock, than any was ever before raiſed in this Kingdom for any Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:206267:19"/>Undertaking, or Project of Trade whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, (which makes it now of ſo much the more Univerſal a Concern to the Nation) but we have alſo had all the Promiſing Hopes of Foreign Aid, that our Hearts could wiſh, eſpecially at <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> where the Merchants of that City entred into Contract with our Deputees, to joyn at leaſt 200000 <hi>l. Sterl:</hi> with us, till, to our gaeat Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize and Loſs, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Miniſters there, did, under Pretence of Special warrant from His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, put a Stop thereto, by giving in a Memorial to the Senate of that City, not only diſowning the Authority of the ſaid Acts of Parliament, and Letters Patent, but alſo Threatning both Senate and Inhabitants, with the King's outmoſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, if they ſhould Countenance, or Joyn with us in any Treaty of Trade, or Commerce, as by the annexed Copies thereof, in <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Engliſh,</hi> may appear, which Memorial we humbly pray, may for the better Information of Your Grace, and Right Honourable Eſtates, be alſo Read in Parliament.</p>
               <p>That after the ſaid Memorial was by the Senate tranſmitted to the Commercij or Body of Merchants of that City, They to aſſert their own Freedom, did Adviſe and Prevail upon our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putees and Agent, who were there for the time, to open Books in the ſaid Merchants Hall, where for ſome days they ſign'd conſiderable Sums purſuant to their ſaid Contract, tho' under Condition to be void, if we ſhould not procure ſome Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from the King, that might render them ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure from the Threatnings, and other inſinuations contained in the ſaid Memorial: And to our
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:206267:20"/>great Diſappointment, thus the Caſe ſtands in Suſpenſe, between them and us to this Day.</p>
               <p>That as the reaſonable (nay and unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able) Proſpect which we had of a powerful Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance from <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> and ſeveral other places (if not obſtructed as aforeſaid) induced us to propoſe a far greater Equipage at firſt, than other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we would have done; So the rendering of theſe Meaſures <hi>abortive,</hi> has not only weakn'd our Stock, leſſen'd our Credit, retarded our firſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, and diſheartned many of our Partners at home, but even alſo ſhackled our Reſolutions and Power from proſecuting at preſent ſeveral other Branches of Foreign and Domeſtick Trades and Improvements which we had in veiw, if we had not met with ſuch Obſtructions and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements from Time to Time.</p>
               <p>That tho' our Company is more immediatly and ſenſibly touched in many Reſpects by ſuch Proceedings, than any other; Yet we humbly conceiving alſo, that the Honour and Independen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Nation, as well as the Authority and Credit of the Parliament is ſtruck at through our ſides; We could not as Country-men, and in Duty to that Collective Power, which gave our Company firſt a Being, but inform His Grace <hi>His Majesty's High Commiſſioner,</hi> and the Right Honourable the <hi>Eſtates of Parliament</hi> of the Premiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, to the End, that the <hi>Great Council</hi> of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, now aſſembled (whom GOD Almighty Direct) may do therein as they in their profound Wiſdom and Diſcretion, ſhall think fit.</p>
               <p>That as to what thereof concerns our Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in Particular, we ſhall humbly beg leave to to Suggeſt further, That our Ships being now at
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:206267:20"/>Sea, on their intended Voyage, the former Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which our Company met with in <hi>England</hi> and elſe where, may give us too juſt grounds to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, that if either through Multiplicity of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Affairs, or otherways howſoever; <hi>Your Grace</hi> and Right Honourable <hi>Estates of Parliament,</hi> ſhould neglect the taking preſent Notice of ſuch Uſage, the Enemies of our Company would be thereby encouraged, either directly or indirectly to purſue their former deſigns of Ruining (if poſſible) all our Meaſures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>May it therefore pleaſe</hi> Your Grace, <hi>and the</hi> Right Honourable <hi>the</hi> Eſtates of Parliament, <hi>to take the Premiſſes into your moſt ſerious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, to vindicat our</hi> Company's <hi>Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Abroad, by ſupporting the Credit of the Acts of</hi> Parliament, <hi>and Letters Patent, by which the ſame is Eſtabliſhed, and wherein the Honour of the</hi> Nation <hi>is ſo much concerned, to take ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual Meaſures (as the ſaid Act provides) for repairing the great Loſs and Damages, which we have already ſuſtained, through the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warantable Treatment above-mentioned, as well as for preventing the like for the future; &amp; withal, to continue to us the Priviledges and Exemptions, mentioned in the ſaid Acts of Parliament, and Letters Patent, for ſome longer time, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the time already elapſed without Execution, and our Stock lying dead, without Improvement, by reaſon of the Obſtructions aforeſaid.</hi>

As to the <hi>French</hi> Deſigns of ſetling thereabouts, it is a Point not to be doubted of: For in order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto they have already been tampering with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of the Natives, ſome of whom they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to have carried into <hi>France;</hi> and we have very good reaſon to believe that a further Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs had been made in that matter before now, were it not the daily Expectations which that Court had of the King of <hi>Spains</hi> Death, which we humbly conceive is a Matter worthy of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's conſideration, and of no ſmall concern to the intereſt of his whole Dominions, tho this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and our Company may ſeem to be more immediatly intereſted, at preſent.</p>
               <p>Your Lordſhip ſees we have in the incloſed Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the King made mention of our laſt Petition, and hope your Lordſhip will take a convenient Opportunity to back the ſame: For as your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip knows, we have already ſuffered conſiderably by encroaching upon our Priviledges, ſo we ought to be very careful, as much as in us lies, not to admit of any dangerous Precedents. And re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally we muſt ſay, We were very much ſurpriz'd the other day, when we underſtood by Letters from the Council of our Colony, that Capt. <hi>Long</hi> Commander of the <hi>Rupert</hi> Prize, who carries his Majeſty's Commiſſion for finding out and fiſhing of Wrecks, ſhould under the colour of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, wherever he went, traduce our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking and Colony to all ſorts of People upon that Coaſt, whether Natives or others, declaring that our ſaid Colony was no other than a pack of Rogues, Vagabounds, Robbers, and broken Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, without any Commiſſion, and that the King
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:206267:27"/>would not own them; nay further, he himſelf came into our Harbour, where he was very courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and reſpectfully treated by all our People there; in recompence of which, he very ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully made it his ſtudy all the while to ſeduce our Men, and did carry off one of our chief Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters, which is a very conſiderable Loſs in that part of the World, and in the Infancy of our Settlement, conſidering how neceſſary a Man he was, and the Difficulty of ſupplying his Place ſo quickly as they may have occaſion for him. This kind of Uſage is really ſo provocking, that we cannot ſuppoſe but that the King may be graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly pleaſed to interpoſe his Royal Authority for preventing the like Uſage in time to come, if his Majeſty were duely informed thereof. So in the confidence of his Majeſty's gracious Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and Protection, and your Lordſhip's hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Endeavours to procure the ſame; this is by Order of the Council-General, and in Name, Preſence, and by Warrant of the Court of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors of our Company, Signed by,</p>

               <p>THe Subſcriber, Ambaſſador Extraordinary from His Catholick Majeſty, finds himſelf obliged, by expreſs orders, to repreſent to your Majeſty, that the King his Maſter having receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yed Information from different places, and laſt of all from the Governour of <hi>Havana,</hi> of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult and attempt of ſome <hi>Scots</hi> Ships, equipt with Men and other things requiſite, who deſign to ſettle themſelves in His Majeſty's Soveraign. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in <hi>America,</hi> and particularly the Province of <hi>Darien.</hi> His Majeſty received thoſe Advices with very much diſcontent, and looks upon the ſame as a token of ſmall friendſhip, &amp; as a rupture of the Alliance between the two Crowns (which His Majeſty hath obſerved hitherto, and always obſerves very religiouſly, and from which ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Advantages and Profites have reſulted both to your Majeſty and your Subjects); As a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of which correſpondence His Majeſty did not expect ſuch ſudden inſults and attempts by your Majeſty's Subjects, and that too in a time of Peace, (without pretext or any cauſe) in the very heart of his Demains.</p>
               <p>All that the King deſires, is, that this may be repreſented to your Majeſty, and that your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty may he acquainted, that he is very ſenſible of ſuch Hoſtilities and unjuſt procedures, againſt which His Majeſty will take ſuch meaſures as he thinks convenient.</p>

                  <p>THe Eſtabliſhment of the Company of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> Trading to <hi>Africa</hi> and the <hi>Indies,</hi> was firſt prepared by an Act of Parliament 1693. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting and Encouraging Perſons in General, to enter into Societies, and Companies, for carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on a Trade to whatſoever Kingdoms, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie or parts of the World, not being in War with His Majeſty, and thereafter perfected by the Act of Parliament 1695, and a Charter thereon under the Great Seal, whereby the ſaid Company was fully Settled with all the Powers, Priviledges, and Immunities in uſe to be granted in ſuch caſes, and particularly with Power to plant Colonies, and build Cities, Towns, and Forts in <hi>Aſia, Africa,</hi> or <hi>America,</hi> upon Places not Inhabited, or upon any other Place, by Conſent of the Natives, and Inhabitants thereof, and not poſſeſs'd by any <hi>European</hi> Prince or State.</p>
                  <p>The Settling of this Company was ſo accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the whole Kingdom, abounding always with Men, and of late Years, very deſirous to enlarge Trade and Commerce, That the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany's
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:206267:29"/>Books being once opened, Subſcriptions for a vaſt Sum were compleated long before the Day prefix'd by the Act of Parliament, and there were few Perſons or Families of any Account within the Kingdom, who were not therein par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly concerned.</p>
                  <p>But tho' the Subſcriptions were ſoon compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Advances made, as readily as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd; yet the Directors and Managers, did proceed with great Deliberation, not being more Cautious to Conceal the Place where they were deſign'd for, than Careful to make ſuch a Choice, as might be exactly in the Terms of their Act and Patent, To wit. <hi>Either not Inhabited, or freely Conſented to, by the Natives, and not poſſeſs'd by any</hi> European <hi>Prince or State, and ſo lyable to no Exception.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In purſuance of theſe Reſolutions, The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany prepared Men, and Proviſions, and ſet out their Ships, and in the Month of <hi>November</hi> 1698, arrived on the Noth-ſide of the <hi>Isthmus</hi> of <hi>Darien</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> they pitched upon a Place never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore poſſeſs'd by the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> and after formal and diſtinct Treaties, obtained the Conſent and Good-will of all the Neighbouring Natives and People.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>French</hi> raiſe a Clamour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Settlement, as an Invaſion of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Poſſeſſions and Dominions, in as much as the Place where the Company hath fixed, lyes as it were in the Middle and Boſom of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Countries, having <hi>Carthagena</hi> on the Eaſt, and <hi>Porto-Bello</hi> on the Weſt, and <hi>Panama</hi> on the South, which is alſo alledged to be contrary to the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:206267:29"/>Treaties betwixt the King of <hi>Great Brittain</hi> and the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> whereby all theſe Countrie's are yeilded and conformed to the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If theſe parts of <hi>America</hi> had been wholly Void and Uninhabited, when the <hi>Spaniards</hi> made their firſt Diſcoveries, and Plantations there, the Queſtion had certainly proceeded upon the head of Occupation, the only Ground acknowledg'd by all Lawyers to determine the Property of all Waſte and Uninhabited Countries, where a formal Diviſion hath not Interveened, as <hi>Grotius</hi> in particular, in his Second Book <hi>de jure Belli</hi> doth abundantly clear, and then the <hi>Spaniards</hi> muſt have further Subſumed, That as they found theſe Countries Waſte, ſo they were the Occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piers and Poſſeſſors thereof; and in Special, that they were the firſt Occupiers and Poſſeſſors of the <hi>Iſthmus</hi> of <hi>Darien,</hi> and the Place where the Company hath Settled, it being moſt certain, that Occupation gives no Right, ſave in ſo far as the Real and Actual Poſſeſſion extends.</p>
                  <p>But ſeing on the other hand, it is Nottour, and by all Acknowledg'd, That the <hi>Spaniards</hi> did not find theſe Parts Waſte, and Uninhabited, this Argument muſt neceſſarily fall; and all that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> can now Plead, is either preſent Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which the Company's Patent owns to be a ſufficient Right to any <hi>European</hi> Prince or State, or the above-mention'd Treaties, as excluſive of the King of <hi>Great Brittain's</hi> Subjects.</p>
                  <p>For clearing then the Claim and Point of Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, The Company denies that ever the <hi>Spaniard</hi> had any Poſſeſſion of the Place where they have Planted; and its obviouſly Incumbent
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:206267:30"/>to the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> if they alledge Poſſeſſion, to prove and inſtruct their Alledgance for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany's Argument being Negative, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Spaniards</hi> did never Poſſeſs the Country where the Company hath Settled, it Undeniably proves it ſelf, as all Lawiers affirm, unleſs the contrary, to wit, The <hi>Spaniards</hi> Poſſeſſion, be evidently made out and proved, which is impoſſible; Nor do the <hi>Spaniards</hi> pretend to prove the ſame; But their Alledgance is, That in theſe large Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of <hi>America,</hi> it were plainly Capricious to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the Actual Poſſeſſion of every particular Place; But ſince they have the Uncontraverted Right and Poſſeſſion of <hi>Carthagena, Porto-Bello,</hi> and <hi>Panama,</hi> which are the Extremities that in a manner environ the <hi>Isthmus</hi> of <hi>Darien,</hi> their Poſſeſſion of theſe Places, muſt infer a Poſſeſſion of the Interjacent Country in which the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany hath Settled, and conſequently, that the Company hath Encroached upon, and Invaded their Right: And further, its ſaid, That the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have actually poſſeſs'd Gold and Silver Mines in <hi>Darien,</hi> much nearer to the Company's Settlement than <hi>Carthgena,</hi> or theſe other Places, and have conſtantly been in uſe to Seize and make Prize of all Ships coming upon the Coaſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Porto Bello</hi> and <hi>Carthagena,</hi> as Invaders of their Poſſeſſions, tho' theſe Ships did really pertain to Friends and Allies.</p>
                  <p>To all which, It is anſwered, 1mo. That the above-mentioned Places belonging to the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> are very far diſtant from the Settlement of the Company, <hi>Carthagena</hi> above Fifty, and <hi>Porto-bello</hi> and <hi>Panama</hi> above Thirty Leagues, which Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are more then ſufficient to render Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:206267:30"/>diſtinct, both as to Right and Poſſeſſion. 2do. It's certain, that <hi>Carthagena, Porto-bello</hi> or <hi>Panama,</hi> cannot be underſtood to have unlimited Territories; if then their Territories be limited, it belongs to the makers of the Objection to ſhow, that the Limits of theſe places do reach to, and comprehend the Place poſſeſs'd by the Company, which neither the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> nor any for them, will ever be able to prove, by the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or any known Rule, or Cuſtom in ſuch Caſes.</p>
                  <p>It hath already been Notic'd, That tho' theſe Countries had been wholly Void, when the <hi>Spaniards</hi> begun to Plant there, they could only by their Poſſeſſion have appropriat as far as they did poſſeſs, and that what was not poſſeſs'd, would have remain'd free, to be appropriated by the Occupation, and poſſeſſion of any other People, a Rule Uncontraverted amongſt all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on the Face of the Earth.</p>
                  <p>But the Caſe of <hi>America</hi> being, That before any Plantations were Settled there, by the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> the Natives were undoubtedly the Poſſeſſors and Proprietors. It follows neceſſarly, That Colonies coming to Settle among them, muſt derive Right from them, and that either by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, Surrender, or Conqueſt, it being impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible in the caſe of Countries inhabited, there can be any other Manner or Mean of Acquiſition; But ſo it is, That the <hi>Spaniards</hi> acquiring after this manner, neither could, nor can pretend to have Right to more than did pertain to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple where they Settled, whether by Conſent, Surrender or Conqueſt.</p>
                  <p>Whence it neceſſarly follows, That ſince <hi>Darien</hi> was a diſtinct Country, and the Inhabitants
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:206267:31"/>thereof a diſtinct People, from thoſe Countries and Nations, where the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have hitherto Settled whether by Conſent, Surrender, or Conqueſt; The <hi>Spaniards</hi> cannot pretend to extend their Right beyond that of their Predeceſſors, and the People &amp; Country of <hi>Darien</hi> muſt ſtill be as free from the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as they were from their Predeceſſors; and conſequently, that the Company coming to poſſeſs with the <hi>Dariens</hi> Conſent, and by their Right, muſt be in the like Condition, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways lyable to either the Claim, or Complaint of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> That the Country and Natives of <hi>Darien</hi> did never ſubmit to, or were conquered by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> muſt ſtand as a ſure Poſition, unleſs the contrary be proven: But further, it is alſo certain, That the <hi>Dariens</hi> were never Repute to have any Dependency even on the great Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires of <hi>Mexico</hi> and <hi>Peru,</hi> much leſs upon the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle places of <hi>Carthagena, Porto-bello,</hi> or <hi>Panama:</hi> Beſides, The <hi>Dariens</hi> have been in frequent War with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> ſince their firſt arrival into theſe Parts, and were never to this day Conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: All which being atteſted by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and other Travellers, who have Written on this Subject; It appears to be beyond Controverſy, That the Company having Settled with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of theſe <hi>Dariens,</hi> muſt have the ſame Right, with the ſame Priviledges and Freedom of Trade which the <hi>Dariens</hi> had, and that both are equally free from all the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Pretenſions,</p>
                  <p>It is a known Caſe that an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man one <hi>Sharp,</hi> having join'd with the <hi>Dariens</hi> againſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> invaded their Territories; he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> as guilty of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:206267:31"/>Robbery and Piracy, but was acquitted, becauſe he acted by Commiſſion from one of the <hi>Darien</hi> Princes, which is an undeniable Evidence, that this Prince and his Countrey were judged to be independent on the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> may alſo have wrought Mines of Gold and Silver within the Iſthmus; but no ſuch poſſeſſion can ſupport their Complaint: The neareſt poſſeſſion of Mines that they can pretend was in Captain <hi>Diego</hi>'s Country, on the Gulf of <hi>Darien,</hi> more than 15 Leagues diſtant from the Company's Settlement; Neither did the <hi>Spaniard</hi> get theſe Mines by Conqueſt, or Purchaſe, but by a plain ſtipulate Permiſſion from Captain <hi>Diego,</hi> and his people, which changed not the Property; And upon Breach of Conditions, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were quickly caſt out, ſo that when the Company came to ſettle on the Iſthmus, it was fully cleared of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> &amp; all their pretences.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Carthagena, Portobello</hi> and <hi>Panama,</hi> are adjacent to, and do in a manner environ the Iſthmus of <hi>Darien;</hi> But that this Vicinity gives to the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> no Claim of Right, is evident from many Inſtances; <hi>Tangier, Cheuta</hi> and <hi>Mamora,</hi> ly in the Boſom of the Empire of <hi>Moroceo,</hi> and yet belong to <hi>European</hi> Princes; The <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> have Neighbouring Settlements upon the River <hi>Gambo</hi> in <hi>Africk,</hi> and all along the Coaſt of <hi>Africk</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and other <hi>European</hi> Princes have their Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements intermixed and contiguous, where they Trade with all Freedom, without any mutual Impeachment. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> have both Plantations upon the Iſland of <hi>Newfoundland,</hi> and the <hi>Dutch</hi> in time of Peace ſettled upon <hi>Long Iſland,</hi> and the adjacent Countrey environed on all hands
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:206267:32"/>by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Plantations, and yet no War en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, but the <hi>Dutch</hi> continued their poſſeſſion till the Exchange was made for <hi>Suranam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleets do neceſſarly paſs betwixt the Cape of <hi>Florida</hi> belonging to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and the <hi>Bahama</hi> Iſlands, yet the <hi>Engliſh</hi> poſſeſs themſelves of the ſaid Iſlands, and have alſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times ſettled at <hi>Port-Royal</hi> in the bottom of the Bay of <hi>Campiechy</hi> in the Gulf of <hi>Mexico,</hi> for cutting of Logwood, and have thence removed and ſettled again at their pleaſure. The <hi>French</hi> have alſo endeavoured to ſettle in the Bay of <hi>Mex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ico,</hi> and lately and more cloſely in the <hi>Samblas</hi> Iſlands on the Coaſt of <hi>Darien;</hi> They likewiſe ſettled a Colony in <hi>Petitguavis</hi> in <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> and in <hi>Guiana</hi> on the Continent, notwithſtanding of the Vicinity of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> The <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Portugueſe</hi> have their Reſpective Plantations on the Coaſt of <hi>Braſil,</hi> to which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> pretend Right as well as to the Iſthmus of <hi>Darien,</hi> ſuch as the Iſlands of <hi>Cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſao,</hi> and <hi>Bowane,</hi> near to <hi>Carthagena</hi> on the Eaſt, and <hi>Suranam</hi> and others upon the Continent, and yet never quarrelled. It is granted that the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> in their exceſſive Jealouſie, and upon the Pretext that by Treaties, none were to Trade in their Ports or Harbours, ſuch as <hi>Carthagena,</hi> and <hi>Porto-bello</hi> without their Licence, have ſeized and made prize of the Ships that they have found upon the Coaſt betwixt the ſaid Places; But firſt, they did this upon pretext of the ſaid Treaties. Secondly, Injury and Violence make no Right.</p>
                  <p>And thirdly, it is moſt certain when the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have been overcomeand beat off in ſuch Attempts, and forced to ſuffer both <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> to cut Logwood on that
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:206267:32"/>Coaſt, yet the <hi>Spaniards</hi> did never complain of any Violation of Right, as knowing perfectly they had none, as may be ſeen in <hi>Dampier, Water,</hi> and other writers.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> at firſt endeavoured to amuſe the World, with the Popes Gift of the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> and after the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s becoming King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and in the Right of that Crown, claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Benefit of the Popes Gift of the <hi>Eaſt-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> he aſſumed the Magnifick Title of <hi>Indiarum Rex:</hi> Yet he was never able to make good his Right, or exclude others by theſe empty Names; but in all Competitions the Pretentions of <hi>Spain,</hi> did either reſolve in Occupation of what was void or ſurrendered, or conqueſt of what was poſſeſs'd by Natives; and that Title was never much regarded, either by <hi>Spain, Portugal,</hi> or any other Prince Popiſh or Proteſtant.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Head which may be pleaded for the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> is, the Treaties that have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Crowns of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi> But 1mo. Granting that the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> will never diſown any Treaty betwixt their King (whom GOD long preſerve and proſper) may be concerned, where are theſe Treaties that exclude either the <hi>Scots</hi> or <hi>Engliſh,</hi> from poſſeſſing <hi>Darien?</hi> if not inhabited, or where Inhabited, with conſent of the Inhabitants? If the <hi>Spaniard</hi> propone upon theſe Treaties, they muſt produce them. 2do. All to be found in the latter Treaties betwixt the ſaid Crowns, ſuch as the Treatie 1667, and the Treatie 1670, which may be underſtood to be the only Regulating Treaties in this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is that in the former, The King of <hi>Spain</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliges himſelf not to moleſt the King of <hi>England,</hi>
                     <pb n="50" facs="tcp:206267:33"/>or his Subjects in their Plantations in <hi>America,</hi> theſe particulars enumerated not by way of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, but becauſe ſome of them had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traverted. And that in the other Treaty 1670, It is agreed in the 7th. Article, That the King of <hi>Great Brittain,</hi> and <hi>His Heirs and Succeſſors,</hi> ſhall have, hold, and poſſeſs, with full Right of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, Property, and Poſſeſſion, all Lands, Regions, Iſles, Colonies, and Lordſhips, ſituated in the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> or any part of <hi>America,</hi> which his ſaid Majeſty, or his Subjects, did then hold or poſſeſs, So that no contraverſie on any pretence, was thereafter to be moved on that Subject. And in the eight Article, That the Subjects of the ſaid King ſhould abſtain from all Commerce and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation, in the Ports and Places, having Forts, Caſtles, or Staples for Merchandiſe, poſſeſſed by either of them. To wit, That the Subjects of <hi>Great Brittain</hi> ſhould not Trade, nor Sail to the Ports nor Places, which the King of <hi>Spain</hi> hath in the <hi>VVeſt-Indies,</hi> nor the Subjects of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> Trade nor Sail to the Places, which the King of <hi>Great Brittain</hi> there poſſeſſes, without Licence given <hi>hincinde,</hi> in the Terms therein ſet down. By which it plainly appears, that all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to, was, and is, That the Kings and their Subjects reſpectively, ſhould forbear Injuries, as likewiſe to Trade and Navigate without Licence in the Ports, Caſtles, and Staples, to either of them belonging, which can no ways exclude the King of <hi>Great Brittain</hi> and his Subjects from Trading, or making new Plantations in to ſuch Places in <hi>America,</hi> as either are not inhabited, or where the King of <hi>Spain</hi> hath no Right. The <hi>Spaniard</hi> may poſitively pretend, that the Treaties provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:206267:33"/>to the King of <hi>England,</hi> and his Subjects of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain particular Places, and generally what they then poſſeſs'd in the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> may be conſtrued an Exception, and import (as it were) an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement, that the reſt of the <hi>Weſt Indies</hi> did belong to the Crown of <hi>Spain.</hi> But, 1mo, The Places provided to the King of <hi>England</hi> and his Subjects are only enumerate for the greater Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Security, becauſe ſome of them had been taken from the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and thereupon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traverted. And, 2do, It is evident by the foreſaid eight Articles, the Reſerve of Trade is equally and mutually provided, and reſtricted to the King of <hi>Great Brittain</hi> and the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> their reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pective Poſſeſſions; ſo that nothing can be eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite from theſe Treaties, to give the King of <hi>Spain</hi> the Right to the whole <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> excepting the foreſaid places poſſeſſed by the King of <hi>England,</hi> nor to ty up the King of <hi>Brittain</hi> and his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, from <hi>making new</hi> lawful Acquiſitions in theſe Parts. <hi>But it is agreed to,</hi> That they ſhould ſecure the one, the other in their reſpective Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions; And thus theſe Treaties have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways underſtood, nor have they hindred the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to enlarge their Poſſeſſions inthe <hi>Weſt Indies</hi> upon juſt Occaſions, which certainly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs as much, if not more to the <hi>Scots.</hi>

                  <p>THe Company of <hi>Scotland</hi> Trading to <hi>Africa</hi> and the <hi>Indies,</hi> having by the other Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial, endeavoured to clear the Juſtice of their Proceedings, as to their Settling a Plantation in the <hi>Iſthmus</hi> of <hi>Darien</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> do further in all Humility Repreſent,</p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:206267:34"/>
                  <p n="1">1mo, That there was never any Enterprize of a more National Concern, than the foreſaid Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is to the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Erecting and Eſtabliſhing of the ſaid Company, was the Unanimous Deſire and Satisfaction of the Nation, all Perſons almoſt, and Families of any Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, did readily ſubſcribe for, and advance conſiderable Sums, for carrying on the Deſigns of the Company, much above what could have been expected. The Succeſs the Company hath had, in overcoming Difficulties, and fixing upon a Place that appears ſo advantageous to Trade and Commerce, hath likewiſe raiſed the Expectation and Deſire of its Continuance and Proſperity, to a far higher Degree than ever was known in any Buſineſs of this Nature: And, <hi>Laſtly,</hi> it is moſt certain, That nothing could be more Grievous and Afflicting to the whole Nation, without Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, than that this Undertaking, ſo far and ſo happily advanced, ſhould meet with the leaſt Diſcouragement, eſpecially from ſuch, whoſe Countenance and Aſſiſtance is ſo earneſtly cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
                  <p n="2">2do, It appears from the whole Circumſtances of this Affair, That the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation can have no Prejudice, but rather Advantage by the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Undertaking: For, <hi>Firſt,</hi> If it ſhall be profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, the Profit evidently redounds to their Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Subjects and good Neighbours. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>Engliſh</hi> have free Acceſs, to come in and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the Profit, when they pleaſe. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Product of the Place is probably like to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt neither of Tobacco nor Suggars, the great Commodities of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Plantations, but of ſuch Goods and Commodities, as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> do not afford. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It is true, That by the Act
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:206267:34"/>of Parliament, and Patent of the Company, all Ships imployed by the Company, are to return to the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> with their Effects: But it is as true, That the ſaid Act and Patent did bear the Liberty and Priviledge of a Free Port, and Mercat for all Strangers that ſhall be pleaſed to Trade with them, who are not under the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Obligation, but may come and go with their Return whether they pleaſe, which cannot but be of Advantage to the whole <hi>Engliſh</hi> Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as to a Free Courſe of Trade. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> It is likeways granted, That by the foreſaid Act of Parliament, the Ships, Goods and Effects what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever belonging to the ſaid Company, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared free of all Cuſtoms and other Duties, for the ſpace of 21 Years, but then four of the ſaid Years are already run, and this ſmall Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was needful to begin ſo great a Work, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of probably the Profit can little more than equal the Expenſes for all that ſpace; And beſides, the Duties of Tobacco and Sugar, not of the Growth of the ſaid Plantation, are excepted, and not diſcharged: And alſo it is evident, That if the Plantation proſper, the foreſaid ſhort Diſcharge of Cuſtoms, and other Duties, will be richly compenſed by the great Increaſe of Trade, and conſequently of His Majeſties Cuſtoms, that may for thereafter be thence expected. And, <hi>Sixth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> The Company and Plantation cannot reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably threaten any Diminution of His Majeſties Cuſtoms in <hi>England;</hi> but on the contrary, this Plantation promiſing a new Trade, far different from the Trade of all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Plantations, and offering to all, the Liberty of a Free Port, muſt rather increaſe the Trade of <hi>England,</hi> both to the King and Subjects Advantage.</p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:206267:35"/>
                  <p>As for the Objection, That the Company, by the Immunity they have from Cuſtoms and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, may Import, and then as freely Export, and ſo underſell any other Nation, during that Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity: Its Anſwered, That the Company in <hi>England</hi> have almoſt the ſame Priviledge, ſince, if they pleaſe to Export after their Return from the Plantations, they are allowed to do it freely with a full Draw-back, excepting only 3 or 4 <hi>per Cent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3tio, It is with Submiſſion Repreſented, That in all Appearance, if the Company of <hi>Scotland</hi> had not ſeized the foreſaid Poſt in <hi>Darien,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> had certainly taken it: And now, that it is diſcovered to be ſo advantageous for Trade, it is not to be doubted, but that the <hi>French,</hi> who ſhew ſuch Earneſtneſs to have the <hi>Scots</hi> excluded, will certainly, if any ſuch thing ſhould happen, poſſeſs themſelves of it, not only to the Hurt of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Plantations, but to the far greater Prejudice, if not the Ruin of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the <hi>Indies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore, All things truly and juſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, it is hoped, that not only the <hi>Engliſh</hi> will become more and more favourable to ſo good a Deſign, but that even the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> will the more eaſily acquieſce to Reaſon and Juſtice, that they ſee a more Powerful Competitor ready to catch hold of an Advantage, that cannot be ſo ſafe for them in the Hands of any other Nation, as in the Poſſeſſion of the foreſaid Company.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> have the moſt conſiderable Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and Plantations in <hi>America,</hi> and are not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, that any other Nation, or People ſhould have ſhare of the Advantages and Benefits they draw from thence, which is not Singular in the preſent Caſe, becauſe they have ever withſtood all Planters, either upon the Continent, or <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican</hi> Iſlands, by Acts of Violence and Hoſtility, as if every Settlement in <hi>America</hi> were an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachment upon the Right of <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is lately a Memorial offered in behalf of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> to one of the Secretaries of State of the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> to the Effect following.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>My Lord Ambaſſador of <hi>Spain</hi> finding himſelf oblig'd, by expreſs Order, to repreſent to His Majeſty of <hi>Brittain</hi> what follows, Prays Mr. <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> to repreſent to his ſaid Majeſty, That the King his Maſter, being informed from ſeveral parts, and laſt of all, by the Governour of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vana,</hi> of the Inſult and Attempt of ſome <hi>Scots</hi> Ships, equipt with Men and Ammunition neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, who endeavours to poſt themſelves in the Soverign Dominions of His Majeſty in <hi>America,</hi> and particularly in the Province of <hi>Darien.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>His Majeſty received this Information with Diſſatisfaction, as a Mark of little Amity, and a Rupture of the Alliance which is betwixt the two Crowns, which His Majeſty hath always obſerved very Religiouſly, and from which ſo much Advantage and Profit hath reſulted, both to His Majeſty and his Subjects, after which good Correſpondence, His Majeſty did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:206267:36"/>ſuch ſudden Attempts &amp; Inſults from His Majeſtys Subjects, and that in time of Peace, without any Pretext or Cauſe, in the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward part of his Dominions.</p>
                     <p>All that the King deſires, That this be preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to His Majeſty of <hi>Brittain,</hi> and that His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty is very ſenſible of ſuch Hoſtilities and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt Procedures, againſt which, His Majeſty will take ſuch Meaſures as are convenient. <hi>London, May</hi> 3d. 1699.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>THe Charge is great, and if it can be made appear, that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> is Invaded, as is pretended, it is but Reaſon there ſhould be juſt Reparation.</p>
                  <p>It muſt be acknowledged, That it is a fair way of dealing, that the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Rights and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions are thus aſſerted by Memorial, and an Opportunity afforded, and that the whole World may be ſatisfied, that His Sacred Majeſty, the King of <hi>Great Brittain,</hi> hath granted no Patent to His Subjects in <hi>Scotland</hi> diſagreeable to Treaties with <hi>Spain,</hi> and that the <hi>Scots</hi> Company have not exceeded the Limits of their Patent, to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There may be many Reaſons offered to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy <hi>Spain,</hi> and all other Nations of <hi>Europe,</hi> except the <hi>French,</hi> that if the <hi>Scots</hi> had not ſettled in that <hi>Isthmus,</hi> or if they were now to remove from it, the ſame would be poſſeſs'd by another People, more dangerous to the Intereſt of <hi>Spain,</hi> and in due time it may be made appear, that the <hi>Scots</hi> Settlement is for the Honour of the King, &amp; the Intereſt of <hi>England,</hi> but the preſent deſign is only to ſatisfie the World, that the Patent granted by His Majeſty, was agreeable to the Treaty with
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:206267:36"/>
                     <hi>Spain,</hi> and that the <hi>Scots</hi> Company have not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the Terms of their Patent, and that they have Right to what they poſſeſs in the <hi>Iſthmus</hi> of <hi>Darien,</hi> according to the Law of Nations, and that moſt part of the Nations in <hi>Europe</hi> have ſettled Plantations in the <hi>American</hi> Iſlands, or Continent, upon no other Foundation than the <hi>Scots.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is the Intereſt and Policy of all Governments, to improve the Natural Product of a Countrey, and to encourage Forreign Trade.</p>
                  <p>The Experience of all Nations makes appear, That nothing contributes ſo effectually to theſe ends, as Forreign Plantations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Scotland</hi> is amongſt the laſt of the Nations of <hi>Europe,</hi> in ſettling Forreign Plantations, tho' there be few that can propoſe more Advantage that way, becauſe the Nation affords many Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Manufacture, and abounds in Men, which is the greateſt Riches, as well as the Strength of a Nation; Yet for want of Forreign Plantations, many have been uſeleſs and burdenſome to their Native Countrey, and have been conſtrained to ſerve Abroad in Forreign Wars, or into Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of other Countreys: And it is to be obſerved, that wherever they have planted, they have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed and multiplied, as particularly in <hi>Ireland,</hi> but no part of the Benefit does accrue to their Native Countrey.</p>
                  <p>The Nation has very long deſired Forreign Settlements of their own, and did make ſome At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts that way, which proved ineffectual for want of due Encouragement, but His Sacred Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, as Father of his Countrey, regarding the Welfare of it, did endue the ſame with ſuteable Encouragements by the 32d. <hi>Act, Par.</hi> 1693. and by the 8th. <hi>Act, Par.</hi> 1695. Yet both theſe Laws
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:206267:37"/>were granted with a due regard to all former Planters; <q>And did only allow them to plant Colonies, build Cities, Towns, and Forts in <hi>Aſia, Africa,</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> upon Places not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited, or in, or upon any other Place, by Conſent of the Natives, or Inhabitants there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and not poſſeſſed by any <hi>European</hi> Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, Potentate, Prince or State.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>By theſe Acts of Parliament, and Patent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, His Majeſty did ſufficiently provide, that the Poſſeſſion of no <hi>European</hi> Prince ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded or moleſted: And if <hi>Spain</hi> be injured, the Company muſt acknowledge, that the Injury flows from them, by exceeding the Limits of their Patent.</p>
                  <p>It remains to be cleared in behalf of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, that they have ſtrictly obſerved the Rules preſcrib'd by the ſaid Acts and Patent.</p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Title to <hi>America</hi> by the Pope's Bull, is rejected by the common Conſent of all the Princes and States in <hi>Europe,</hi> who could not have ſettled there without Injury to <hi>Spain,</hi> if the Pope's Bull had been a ſufficient Title; and neither <hi>Spain</hi> or <hi>Portugal</hi> hath relyed upon that Title, the one having planted in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> and the other in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> without regard to it: And this Title is ſufficiently diſcuſſed by <hi>Grotius</hi> in his <hi>Mare Liberum, Cap.</hi> 3. and will never be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on any where, and leaſt of all in <hi>Brittain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>America</hi> being inhabited by Natives, before <hi>Spain</hi> or any <hi>European</hi> People ſettled there, it is moſt certain, that the Right and Property did o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginally belong to theſe Natives, becauſe the Earth was created for; and freely given by the Creator to the Children of Men, and the moſt Ancient and Uncontraverted Right of Property
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:206267:37"/>of the Earth is by Occupation and Poſſeſſion, which is an outward Act of the Body <hi>quaſi poſitio pedis,</hi> and not an inward Act of the Mind, which cannot be known to others, beſide many Mens wills might concur in wiſhing and liking the ſame thing, but their Bodies cannot concur in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it, and an outward Act of Poſſeſſion warns others to abſtain.</p>
                  <p>The Property that originally belonged to the Natives, could only be transferred from them to <hi>Spain</hi> by Conqueſt or Conſent, and <hi>Spain</hi> can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend neither of theſe Titles to the <hi>Iſthmus</hi> where the <hi>Scots</hi> have ſettled.</p>
                  <p>It is alledg'd for <hi>Spain,</hi> That they do poſſeſs the <hi>Iſthmus</hi> of <hi>Darien,</hi> in as far as they are undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Maſters of the Bay of <hi>Panama,</hi> and the whole Coaſt of the <hi>Iſthmus</hi> upon the South Sea: They have likewiſe <hi>Carthagena</hi> and <hi>Portobello</hi> on the North Sea, and they are Maſters of the whole Countrey betwixt <hi>Carthagena</hi> and <hi>Portobello,</hi> and ſo muſt be reckoned Poſſeſſors of all, becauſe Poſſeſſion doth not require the particular Occupation of every part of a Countrey, but Occupation of one part is a ſufficient Act to demonſtrate the Will and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to poſſeſs the whole Pertinents: And the <hi>Spaniards</hi> having poſſeſs'd theſe two Extremes, the middle Space belongs to them, eſpecially ſeing they have alſo ſettled in other Places betwixt theſe two, as their Conveniency did require, tho' they did afterwards quite theſe Poſſeſſions, as particularly they once poſſeſſed <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi> and did alſo plant within the River <hi>Darien,</hi> and tho' they did quite theſe Poſſeſſions, they did not relinquiſh or repudiate their Right, but being better informed, they chooſed more convenient Seats, but ſtill reckoned themſelves Proprietors of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:206267:38"/>the whole <hi>Iſthmus,</hi> and divided the ſame in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Juriſdictions. And the Natives upon that <hi>Iſthmus</hi> were a mean inconſiderable People not to be regarded, who could not be thought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain any Right or Property in Oppoſition to the Power of <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They further add, That <hi>Spain</hi> hath been conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as undoubted Proprietors of the Bay of <hi>Mexico,</hi> and of that <hi>Iſthmus,</hi> by other Nations in Chriſtendom, and moſt particularly by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as is well known, and will clearly appear in two remarkable Inſtances.</p>
                  <p>Several <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants having advanc'd their Stock, for ſettling a Plantation at <hi>Port-Royal</hi> in the Bottom of the Bay of <hi>Campechay,</hi> for cutting of Logwood, they deſired the Countenance and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the Government, for carrying on this profitable Trade: The Caſe was conſidered by the Council of <hi>England,</hi> and it was not found juſt, to allow the Protection of the Government, but were only left in a Permiſſive State, to manage their Trade upon their Peril.</p>
                  <p>The Second Caſe, which comes cloſer to the preſent Queſtion, was a Propoſal by certain <hi>Engliſh</hi> Undertakers to ſettle in <hi>Darien,</hi> as the <hi>Scots</hi> have done, which being brought to the Council of Trade of <hi>England,</hi> and by them laid before the Lords Juſtices in His Majeſties Abſence, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the King himſelf; Upon a full Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the Caſe, that Project was thought to be an Encroachment upon <hi>Spain,</hi> and let fall.</p>
                  <p>The King himſelf, and Council of <hi>England,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſatisfied of the Right of <hi>Spain,</hi> in theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Caſes of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Undertakers, the ſame Judgment ought to follow, in relation to the <hi>Scots</hi> Company.</p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:206267:38"/>
                  <p>To all that is alledged, it's ſhortly and clearly Anſwered, That <hi>Spain</hi> hath neither Right by Treaties nor Poſſeſſion to the Countrey now poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd by the <hi>Scots:</hi> And, 1ſt. Tho' it be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have more Strength, and larger Poſſeſſions on the South, than upon the North Sea, yet no Poſſeſſion there can be exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the North-ſide of the <hi>Iſthmus,</hi> being poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd by a People Independent, who never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> or became ſubject to them: The <hi>Spaniards</hi> indeed have made great Settlements upon the South Sea, and in ſo far as they have poſſeſs'd, have reſtricted the Natives to narrower Bounds; but the <hi>Indians</hi> ſtill continuing to poſſeſs what remains, Poſſeſſion on the Coaſt, or the Mouths of Rivers on the South Sea, can never be extended to the North Coaſt: And the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi> can condeſcend upon no Ground in Law or Reaſon for ſuch an Extenſion, nor can they make appear, that what the <hi>Scots</hi> poſſeſs is Part and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent of their Plantation, eſpecially conſidering that the <hi>Iſthmus</hi> of <hi>Darien</hi> is naturally divided by a Ridge of high Hills running from Eaſt to Weſt.</p>
                  <p>Neither doth the poſſeſſion of <hi>Carthagena</hi> and <hi>Porto-bello,</hi> give Right to the interveening Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, which is above 80 Leagues or 240 <hi>Engliſh</hi> Miles, and theſe particular Forts, as well as the whole <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Plantations on the South Sea, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fixt without conſent of the Natives, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue their Poſſeſſion in the interveening Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, without any Subjection to, or acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Spaniard:</hi> It lyes upon the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to condeſcend by what Rule the Limits of theſe Poſſeſſions can be ſo far extended.</p>
                  <p>As to what is alledged, That the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have other Plantations nearer to the <hi>Scots</hi> Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:206267:39"/>from which they removed, but ſtill retain Poſſeſſion and Juriſdiction.</p>
                  <p>It is Anſwered, Admitting the matter of Fact. as alledged, it comes to nothing; For ſtill it is to be remembred, That the <hi>Spaniard</hi> will not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to have planted with the conſent of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives: Nor, that the <hi>Darien Indians</hi> have ever ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd Subjection; but they planted by Force and Violence: And therefore, whatever Forts they made in the <hi>Isthmus</hi> of <hi>Darien,</hi> the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that theſe Plantations were left, the Right and Poſſeſſion of the Natives did return.</p>
                  <p>It is freely acknowledged, That Poſſeſſion lawfully obtain'd by an outward Act of the Body, is retain'd by Acts of the Mind, if no other poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs; but when Poſſeſsion is taken by way of Fact, and not actually detained, the Right and Poſſeſsion returns to the lawful Proprietor.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This alledged Poſſeſsion of <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi> and in the <hi>River of Darien,</hi> is only pretended to have been at their firſt Settlement in <hi>America,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they poſſeſs'd <hi>Carthagena</hi> and <hi>Porto-bello.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. None of theſe pretended Settlements are within 20 Leagues of the <hi>Scots</hi> Colony; And tho <hi>Spain</hi> had yet Plantations there, the Limits could as little be extended to 20 Leagues beyond the actual Poſſeſsion as to a Thouſand: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can the <hi>Spaniards</hi> prove any Act of Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over the <hi>Darien Indians,</hi> whatever Title they may think fit to give to Governours or Vice-Roy's in <hi>America,</hi> the <hi>Scots</hi> do neither know, nor are oblig'd to notice the ſame: If Titles were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> aſſumes a Glorious Title of <hi>Indiarum Rex,</hi> but he has no more Juriſdiction over the <hi>Darien Indians,</hi> than in the Plantations of any other <hi>European</hi> Prince.</p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:206267:39"/>
                  <p>As to what is alledg'd upon the Opinions given by the King and Council of <hi>England,</hi> in relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to His Majeſty's <hi>Engliſh</hi> Subjects projecting Settlements in <hi>America,</hi> The Circumſtances of the Projects, and the Motives of any Reſolution taken in them, are wholly unknown to the <hi>Scots,</hi> and nothing can be founded on ſuch Matters of Fact, unleſs the whole Circumſtances were Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentically inſtructed or acknowledg'd, but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was thought proper in theſe Caſes, nothing can be inferred from thence to determine this.</p>
                  <p>A Project is to be regulated either by Law or by Conveniency; And it's very ordinary and ſute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, That his Majeſty and the Government may diſcourage the Project of an Undertaking, if not Convenient, tho lawful: But when a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is Undertaken, Carried on, and a Settlement made in purſuance of expreſs Acts of Parliament, and conform to a Patent, there's no more place to Deliberate what is fit, but what is Lawful.</p>
                  <p>If the whole Circumſtances were known, many Diſparities might alſo appear, and from the bare relation of the Caſe of the intended Settlement in the Bay of <hi>Campechay</hi> a manifeſt Diſparity is evident.</p>
                  <p>The Bay of <hi>Campechay</hi> is in the Province of <hi>Nicaragua,</hi> in the Dioceſs of <hi>Chiapo,</hi> which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince and Biſhoprick, are part of the Ancient <hi>Empire</hi> of <hi>Mexico,</hi> which was conquered by <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By the Conqueſt of <hi>Mexico,</hi> the King of <hi>Spain</hi> as Conquerour, had Right of Sovereignty as far as the Dominions of <hi>Mexico</hi> did extend, and the Right and Poſſeſsion of the Conquered People may reaſonably be reckoned to become the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſsion of the Conquerour; And therefore a Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>Nicaragua</hi> or Bay of <hi>Campechay</hi> might be
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:206267:40"/>reckoned a down Right Encroachment upon <hi>Spain,</hi> which cannot be drawn in Conſequence to a Settlement upon <hi>Darien,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Spaniards</hi> can condeſcend upon no Title or Right beyond their actual Poſſeſsion; for the <hi>Dariens</hi> were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſubdued, nor did they ever depend upon <hi>Mexico</hi> or <hi>Peru,</hi> or any Prince or People ſubdued by the <hi>Spanirds.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And further, whatever be urged from theſe Caſes, yet it can be made appear, That the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking to ſettle in <hi>Campechay</hi> was effectual, and the Cart is marked <hi>Port-Royal Engliſh-Colony;</hi> and 'tis known that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> cutt Logwood at <hi>Cape-Catach</hi> in <hi>Jucatan</hi> till the Charge of Carriage ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd it unprofitable, and thereafter Settled at <hi>Port-Royal</hi> for the ſame Effect, where there is plenty of Logwood appropriated to the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is alſo acknowledg'd, That the <hi>Darien-Indians</hi> are no powerful People, or able by themſelves to reſiſt the Impreſsions of <hi>Spain,</hi> but the point of Right and Property is the ſame in Rich and Poor, Strong and Weak, and they might lawfully transfer their Right, and aſſume the <hi>Scots</hi> or any other Nation to ſupport or maintain the Right and Poſſeſsion of that <hi>Isthmus,</hi> in as far as it was free from the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Dominions.</p>
                  <p>Yet the <hi>Dariens</hi> were not wholly neglected by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> as inconſiderable, for there have been frequent and almoſt conſtant Wars between them and <hi>Spain,</hi> in which the ſeveral Captains and <hi>Carriques</hi> have joyned together, and there is a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Caſe of <hi>Barth: Sharp,</hi> who being accuſed in <hi>England</hi> as guilty of Piracy and Robbery commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon the <hi>Indians,</hi> he defended himſelf as acting by Commiſsion from Independent Native <hi>Indians</hi> then at War with <hi>Spain,</hi> and was acquitted.</p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:206267:40"/>
                  <p>The Right of the <hi>Scots</hi> Colony, as flowing from the Native <hi>Indians,</hi> is already ſufficiently cleared, according to the moſt Ancient and Authentick Laws of Property, acknowledg'd by all Nations: And for a further Evidence and Demonſtration of what has been aſſerted, and already ſufficient-proven the Settlement of the <hi>Engliſh, French, Danes, Portugueſes,</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> will all be found to be Bottomed on the ſame Ground.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> are the moſt Ancient Planters, and if <hi>Spain</hi> pretend to any Univerſal Title, either by Occupation of a part, or by the Popes Gift, or any other Right, he thereby excludes the Claim of all Poſterior Planters, either in the Continent, or <hi>American</hi> Iſlands, which could not be thought to be ſeparate and indifferent Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions: And if <hi>Spain</hi> recede from any Univerſal Title to the whole, it will not be poſsible to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend his Claim beyond his proper Poſſeſsion, or the Poſſeſsions of theſe that are Subduced and Conquered by <hi>Spain:</hi> And if this be called in Queſtion, it is expected, That ſome other Title will be condeſcended upon, that may clear the Limits and Extent of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Colonies, ſo as to make a Difference betwixt the <hi>Scots</hi> Settlement in <hi>Darien,</hi> and the Settlement of other Princes in the <hi>American</hi> Iſlands or Continent.</p>
                  <p>The Empires of <hi>Mexico</hi> and <hi>Peru</hi> are known, and may be yielded to <hi>Spain,</hi> but the remainder of that vaſt Countrey was anciently poſſeſs'd by little Princes, or rather Captains or Heads of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies or Cariques, who have no Dependance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on each other, nor upon any Prince or Potentate, but by Leagues and Agreement for mutual De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. Thus it is known, That the Land of the <hi>Amazons</hi> was poſſeſs'd by the Natives; And it is
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:206267:41"/>remarkable, That upon the Banks of <hi>Amazon,</hi> there are Fifty different Nations: So it is in <hi>Braſil,</hi> in <hi>Chili, Paragua, Florida, Carolina, Virginia,</hi> and generally over all the Continent, as well as in the Iſlands of <hi>America,</hi> and likewiſe in <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africa:</hi> And therefore, <hi>European</hi> Princes have planted promiſcuouſly, as they found Convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, without Injury or Encroachment upon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Planters.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> poſſeſs the Continent from <hi>New-England</hi> to <hi>Carolina,</hi> without the Interpoſition of Colonies belonging to any <hi>European</hi> Prince, yet the <hi>Dutch,</hi> in time of Peace, ſet down upon <hi>Long-Iſland,</hi> and the Countrey now called <hi>New-York,</hi> betwixt <hi>New-England</hi> and <hi>Penſilvania,</hi> and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to poſſeſs till the end of the War 1667: At which time, <hi>New-York</hi> was exchanged for <hi>Suranam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Plate-Fleet do neceſſarly paſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Cape-Florida</hi> and the <hi>Bahaman-Iſlands,</hi> yet the <hi>Engliſh</hi> poſſeſs theſe Iſlands, which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> did mightily reſent, and uſed the <hi>Engliſh</hi> very bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barouſly upon it, yet <hi>Spain</hi> not being able to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy any unlawful Title, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> did maintain their Poſſeſſion.</p>
                  <p>Whatever be alledg'd, That the Government did not interpoſe for eſtabliſhing a Logwood-Trade, yet it's certain, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate the Logwood at <hi>Cape-Catch</hi> in <hi>Jucatan,</hi> till it was exhauſted, and they afterwards ſettled at <hi>Port-Royal</hi> in the Bay of <hi>Campechay,</hi> for carrying on the ſame Trade, which was never queſtion'd by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>French</hi> have ſeveral times endeavoured to ſettle in the River <hi>de Spiritu Sancto</hi> in the Bay of <hi>Mexico,</hi> and alſo the <hi>Samballo-Iſlands</hi> upon the Coaſt of <hi>Darien,</hi> and have actually ſettled a Colony in
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:206267:41"/>
                     <hi>Petit-Guavis</hi> in <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> the reſt of that Iſland being poſſeſt by the <hi>Spaniards:</hi> The <hi>French</hi> have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a Settlement in <hi>Guiana</hi> in the <hi>Terra-Firma,</hi> and ſeveral Forts upon the Coaſt of <hi>Caribana,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove twelve or thirteen <hi>American</hi> Iſlands.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> have alſo the City of <hi>Coro</hi> in the North of <hi>Terra-Firma,</hi> and <hi>Suranam,</hi> and certain Forts upon the Coaſt of <hi>Guiana</hi> and <hi>Curaſao,</hi> and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>American</hi> Iſlands.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Portugueſe</hi> have the Coaſt of <hi>Braſil</hi> divided into many Captainſhips. The Intereſt of <hi>Spain</hi> was ever oppoſit to all theſe Settlements in <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi> and wherever they were ſtrong enough, they attempted to expel the Planters, without regard to Peace or War, whereof the <hi>Scots</hi> did formerly feel the Effects, in their Plantation at <hi>Carolina</hi> hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> from whence they were expelled: Theſe things were done by way of Fact, but it is the firſt time that ever <hi>Spain</hi> did openly pretend a Right beyond actual Poſſeſſion, which was never ſuſtained by any <hi>European</hi> Prince. And it is deſired and expected, that there may be a further Condeſcendance of the Right and Title of <hi>Spain,</hi> to exclude other Planters by the Conſent of the Natives, where <hi>Spain</hi> hath no actual Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, or Exerciſe of any Juriſdiction.</p>
                  <p>It is further alledged for <hi>Spain,</hi> That all the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs in <hi>America</hi> was ſettled by the Pacification 1670, betwixt the Kings of <hi>Brittain</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> which did confirm all the Plantations poſſeſs'd by <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colonies, and left the Remainder of <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica</hi> to <hi>Spain,</hi> and whatever happened before that General Treaty, could be no Rule thereafter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there was almoſt perpetual War with <hi>Spain</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> which were never ſettled or compoſed till the Treaty 1670, which did preſuppoſe and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:206267:42"/>the Right of <hi>Spain</hi> to all that was not poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the King of <hi>Brittain</hi>'s Subjects.</p>
                  <p>As to the Inſtance of <hi>Sharp,</hi> it is not denyed that he was acquitted, and amongſt others did propone that Defence, That he Acted by Commiſſion from an <hi>Indian</hi> Prince; but that Defence was look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as a Jeſt, and it was not for that Reaſon that he was acquitted.</p>
                  <p>It is Anſwered, There was indeed a Treaty in the Year 1670, concerning <hi>America</hi> in particular, whereby it was provided, <q>That the King of <hi>Brittain</hi> ſhould have, hold and enjoy for ever, with full Right of Sovereignty, Dominion and Property, all thoſe Lands, Regions, Iſlands, Colonies, and Places whatſoever ſituated in the <hi>Weſt-Indics,</hi> or any part of <hi>America,</hi> which the ſaid King and his Subjects did then hold and poſſeſs;</q> From which Article the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would infer, that all the reſt of <hi>America</hi> was loſt by the King of <hi>Brittain,</hi> as a Right and Dominion of <hi>Spain,</hi> becauſe that <hi>Spain</hi> ratifies the Poſſeſſion ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the King of <hi>Brittain,</hi> and there is not a mutual Ratification of the Poſſeſſion of the King of <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Article can bear no ſuch Inference, for,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The King of <hi>Brittain</hi> and his Subjects did not then, nor do they now in the leaſt queſtion the Poſſeſſions of the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and his Subjects, but the King of <hi>Spain</hi> did very much queſtion the Right of the King of <hi>Brittain</hi> to ſeveral of his <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican</hi> Plantations, not only upon the general Ground of an Univerſal Title to all the <hi>Weſt-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> which no <hi>European</hi> Prince will bear, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe upon particular Claims, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had beat out the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and enjoyed what had been once poſſeſs'd by them in ſeveral places: And the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:206267:42"/>former Treaties with <hi>Spain</hi> eſpecialy that in the Year 1667, were only general, eſtablſhing a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Peace betwixt the Dominions and Terito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of <hi>Brittain</hi> and theſe of <hi>Spain:</hi> But the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion remaining anent the Right and Dominion of theſe <hi>American</hi> Settlements to which the King of <hi>Spain</hi> did lay ſtill a Claim, The Treaty 1670, did renounce his Claim to the Colonies in the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Poſſeſsion, but did determine nothing as to thoſe parts of <hi>America,</hi> which were never Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd by the <hi>Spaniard</hi> or <hi>Brittiſh,</hi> and if it had been intended, that the Right of <hi>Spain</hi> to all <hi>America</hi> that was not poſſeſs'd by ſome other <hi>European</hi> Prince ſhould be aſſerted, and declared the ſame would not have been left to ſuch remote conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, but would have been ſpecially expreſs'd.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The whole Tenor of that Treaty does ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently clear, that no ſuch thing was intended as to preſuppoſe, much leſs to aſſert the Right of <hi>Spain</hi> beyond actual poſſeſſion. For by the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Article of the Treaty, it is provided, <q>That there be an Univerſal Peace in <hi>America,</hi> as in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of the World between the Kings of Great <hi>Brittain</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> and between the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, States, Plantations, Colonies, Forts, Cities, Iſlands and Dominions belonging to either of them; and between the People and Inhabitants under their reſpective Obedience.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Article in the Treaty relating to <hi>America,</hi> only doth clearly demonſtrate, that both Kings were ſet upon an equal foot, and did Treat for themſelves and the People and Inhabitants under their reſpective Obedience, and no further; ſo that all matters were left untouched that did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern parts not Inhabited or poſſeſs'd by Natives, who were never under obedience to either Prince,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:206267:43"/>nor would the Treaty have been for Plantations, Colonies, Forts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> equally and mutually, if either King had pretended an univerſal Title or Right beyond Poſſeſsion.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Eight Article doth yet further clear, that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had no Univerſal Claim, but according to his Poſſeſsion, which Article provides, that the Subjects, Inhabitants and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners of the Dominions of each Confederate, ſhall forbear to Sail to, or Trade in the Ports and Havens which are fortified with Caſtles, Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zines or Ware-Houſes, and in all other Places whatſoever, poſſeſs'd by the other Party in the Weſt <hi>Indies.</hi> To wit, the Subjects of Brittain ſhall not Sail into, and Trade in the Havens and Places, which the Catholick King holds in the <hi>Indies,</hi> nor in like manner ſhall the Subjects of the King of <hi>Spain</hi> Sail into, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Clauſe is plainly reſtrictive upon the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> That the Subjects of the King of <hi>Brittain</hi> ſhall not Trade into theſe places of the <hi>Indies</hi> which belong to <hi>Spain;</hi> for thereby it preſuppoſes that <hi>Spain</hi> has no Univerſal Title, and its left free to the King of <hi>Brittains</hi> Subjects to Sail into, and Trade in all Ports and Havens which have no Fortifications, Caſtles, Magazines; or Ware-Houſes Poſſeſs'd by the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently it was lawful to have Sailed to, and Traded with the <hi>Darien Indians</hi> where the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had no Fortifications, Caſtles, Magazines or Ware-Houſes, nor can clear any manner of Poſſeſsion, and if they might Trade with the <hi>Indians</hi> it muſt be acknowledg'd they might Settle among them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>It's alſo provided by the Tenth Article, that in caſe the Ships of either Party be forced
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:206267:43"/>by ſtreſs of Weather, or otherwiſe into the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, Creeks, Bays or Ports belonging to the other in <hi>America,</hi> they ſhall be treated there with all Humanity and Kindneſs;</q> Which Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle ſtates both Kings again upon an equal foot, and mentions the Right of both as reſtrictive to particular Rivers, Creeks, Bays, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in <hi>America</hi> as if neither Party claimed Univerſal Title over all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>The 15th. Article of the ſaid Treaty pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides, that the ſame ſhall in nothing derogate from any preheminency, Right or Dominion of any Confederate in the <hi>American</hi> Seas, Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels or Waters, but that they have and retain the ſame in as full and ample manner as may of right belong unto them, providing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways that the Liberty of Navigation ought in no manner to be diſturbed.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Artiele relates to certain Preheminencies and Priviledges claim'd by <hi>Spain</hi> in the <hi>American</hi> Sea, which by the Treaty was not yeilded, but left in the ſame ſtate as formerly; and if the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had pretended to an Univerſal Right o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all <hi>America,</hi> in ſo far as is not poſſeſs'd by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>European</hi> Princes, why was he more carefull to preſerve his Claim of Sovereignty in the Seas, and forgot his Dominion upon the main Land? There can be no other reaſon for it, but becauſe there was no ſuch thing in proſpect, as appears by the whole Tenor of the Treaty.</p>
                  <p>Nothing hath been alledged in behalf of <hi>Spain</hi> to make any diſparity betwixt all the Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that have been made in <hi>America</hi> by the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the King of <hi>Brittain</hi> or other Princes, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Treaty 1670: Which when duly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, makes no diſparity at all. For albeit the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:206267:44"/>Poſſeſsion of the King of <hi>Brittains</hi> Subjects be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by confirmed; yet it will not be acknowledg'd by the King of Great <hi>Brittain,</hi> or any other Prince that the Settlements made by their Subjects were illegal or violent, untill confirmed by the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and all Nations who have Planted there muſt ſuſtain and juſtify the <hi>Scots</hi> Settlement, or acknowledge that the Settlement of their own Subjects were injurious to the Right of <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is not, nor can be denyed, that the <hi>Dariens</hi> have been at frequent War with <hi>Spain,</hi> altho they pretend, that the <hi>Dariens</hi> were rather Rebels than Enemies. That is only for to beg the Queſtion, for the Natives having the Ancient undoubted Right, it muſt be inſtructed, that they became Subjects before they could be Rebels.</p>
                  <p>And tho' it be alledged, that what was done in <hi>Sharp</hi>'s Caſe was reckoned a Jeſt, and that he was not acquitted upon that ground, as acting by Commiſsion from the <hi>Dariens;</hi> yet the matter of Fact is certain and known, and was indeed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked by all <hi>England,</hi> that <hi>Sharp</hi> join'd with the <hi>Dariens,</hi> did commit acts of Hoſtility and carried away great booty from the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and was purſued for Reſtitution in <hi>England,</hi> and did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pone a Defence. That he acted by Commiſsion from an Independent People, and was acquitted by a competent Judicature in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe matters of Fact being all acknowledged, it muſt be thought that a Deciſion in the way of Juſtice was no Jeſt, but according to the Law of the Nation.</p>
                  <p>To Conclude and Sum up the whole Matter, The <hi>Scots</hi> did not move one foot, untill they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd two Acts of Parliament, and a Patent in their favours. Theſe Acts (tho' very ample)
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:206267:44"/>were framed with a juſt regard to former Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, who by the expreſs Tenor of the ſaid Laws were not to be invaded or moleſted in their Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion; even the juſt Right and Property of the Infidel Natives was conſidered, and the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers not allowed to diſpoſſeſs them by Force and Violence, but to Plant with their conſent: Upon the faith of theſe Laws, a greater Stock was advanced in <hi>Scotland</hi> than ever was raiſed by any other Nation, upon the firſt project of a Forreign Plantation; the Directors of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany did very narrowly and exactly conſider all the Treaties with <hi>Spain,</hi> and pitched upon a place, that the whole World conſiders to be of a great value for founding and raiſing a profitable Trade to the Honour of the King who (as the Father of the Countrey) did endue them with ample and juſt Priviledges, to the encreaſe of the Strength and Riches of the Iſle of <hi>Brittain,</hi> which is all under the Government of one Monarch, of one Religion and Intereſt, and can have no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Friends or Enemies without endangering the whole. In one word, The <hi>Scots</hi> Company have acted deliberatly, for advantage to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the Nation, and the Iſle of <hi>Brittain;</hi> they have only uſed their own Right and have wronged no Nation or People, nor exceeded the Limits of their Patent in any circumſtance. And if any will ſtand up for the Intereſt of <hi>Spain,</hi> and call in queſtion the matters of Fact and principles of Law above aſſerted, which are generally known and need not to be confirmed by particular Citations. they may aſſuredly expect that what has been affirmed ſhall be made further clear and evident beyond contradiction, and whatever Obſtacles
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:206267:45"/>or Difficulties have, or may fall in, <hi>Ardua quae Pulchra,</hi> the undertaking was deliberate, juſt for the intereſt of the Nation, and with more regard to the Right of former Planters and Natives than any former Project of that Nature.</p>

               <p>WE think it needleſs to trouble your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips with a repetition of the many Steps, Difficulties and Diſcouragements that we met
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:206267:52"/>with all along both abroad and at home, ſince the beginning of this Undertaking, the moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable of them being already particularly known to your Lordſhips But maugre all thoſe Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, we have with a great deal of Trouble and vaſt Expenſes, ſettled a Plantation in one of the moſt valuable and impregnable Places in all <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica,</hi> ſituated on the North-ſide of the Iſtumus of <hi>Darien</hi> called by us <hi>Caledonia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As no Nation in <hi>Europe</hi> ever begun any ſuch Settlement with ſo conſiderable a Strength of Men, Ships, and other Neceſſaries, as we did: So no inſtance can be given of any Settlement e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heretofore made, that had ſo hopeful an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect in ſo ſhort a time as our Plantation aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>But to our and the Nation's ineſtimable Loſs, we have very ſurprizing Advices of our Peoples having deſerted the ſaid Settlement by reaſon of Proclamations iſſued forth in all his Majeſty's Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of <hi>America,</hi> ſtrictly forbidding all his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Subjects to hold any manner of Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with our ſaid Colony, and that no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Proviſions, Arms, Ammunition, or other neceſſaries whatſoever, ſhould be tranſported or carried to them, either in their own Veſſels or any other Ship or Veſſel for their uſe; and that under the outmoſt Pains, Penalties, and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feitures mentioned in the ſaid Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:206267:53"/>Credit for buying of Proviſions, till our own Ships and Recruits ſhould come up to them.</p>
               <p>We have taken ſuch further meaſures, as ſeem'd moſt reaſonable to us upon this unexpected Emergency, but have too good ground to fear, that not only what we have already done, but even all that we are able to do, muſt prove inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual, if the King and his Parliament of this Kingdom, do not give ſome encouraging Marks of their Favour and Protection to our ſaid Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and Colony: Wherefore we have in all hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Duty Petition'd his Majeſty that he would be graciouſly pleaſed to take off the Force of the ſaid Proclamations, and allow his ſaid Parliament to meet at the day appointed in <hi>November</hi> next, or as ſoon as poſſibly may be, to give their Advice and Aſſiſtance in ſuch a weighty and general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern.</p>

And the Council-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral having ſignified ſo much to your Lordſhip by a Letter, wherein they entreated, that you would be pleaſed to introduce him to the King, and give your Concurrence in procuring a Gracious Return to what he had in Commiſſion, and which he was to Communicate to your Lordſhip. We are ſurpriz'd to find this day by a Letter from the Lord Chancellour; that the King will not allow Lord <hi>Baſil Hamilton</hi> to have Acceſs, becauſe he did not wait upon his Majeſty when he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly at <hi>London.</hi> But his Lordſhip being ſent by, and having his Inſtructions from the Council-General, We the Court of Directors can ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to it, other than to entreat your Lordſhip that you'd uſe your Intereſt with his Majeſty, to allow Lord <hi>Baſil Hamilton,</hi> to have Acceſs to His

               <p>IT is evident by the whole Strain of Three ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Acts of Parliament, together with His Majeſty's Letters Patent under the Great Seal of this Kingdom, in favours of the ſaid Company, That the Wiſdom of the King and Right Honourable Eſtates did intend, that all ſuch Advantages as might ariſe by the eſtabliſhing of ſuch a Company, ſhould be of as univerſally a National Concern as poſſible; And in order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, were pleaſed to endow it with large Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges and Immunities, ſuteable to the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of an Infant-Company, and the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of its Deſigns: And leſt that it ſhould fail in the Execution, for want of a ſufficient Stock to carry on ſuch an Undertaking, all imaginable Parliamentary Encouragement was given to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of all Ranks, Ages and Sexes, both within and without the Kingdom, whether Natives or Foreigners, to become Partners and Adventurers in the Joynt-Stock of the ſaid Company, as is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:206267:62"/>manifeſt by the 42d. Act of the 5th Seſſion of this current Parliament, eſpecially calculated for that end only.</p>
               <p>Upon the publick Faith of having due Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the enjoyment of theſe unqueſtionable Priviledges and Immunities, as having received their Sanction from His Majeſty. and the unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Suffrage of the great Council of the Nation as aforeſaid, many Perſons of all Ranks and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees were thereby induced to become Adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers in the Joynt-Stock of our ſaid Company, in in ſo much that in a very ſhort time, a much more conſiderable Stock was ſubſcrib'd for within this Kingdom, than was ever before ſo much as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd here upon any project whatſoever, ſince we were a Nation:</p>
               <p>Being thus entred into a Society, We and our Conſtituents have purſuant to the intentions of the Acts of Parliament and Letters Patent above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd, with much care and trouble, and a great Expenſe of Treaſure, after having ſtruggled with many unexpected Obſtructions and Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſetled a Plantation by the Name of <hi>Caledonia,</hi> in one of the moſt Healthful, Fruitfull, natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impregnable, and every way valuable Places in all <hi>America,</hi> as is univerſally acknowledged by all Per'ons of Experience in ſuch Matters as well as by the General Conſent of ſuch as have been there: And as a manifeſt proof thereof tho our ſaid Plantation be ſettled moſt ſtrictly in the terms of the Acts of Parliament and Letters Patent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bovementioned, yet it has raiſed the Jealouſy of ſome, and Envy of others, of the moſt knowing and conſiderable Trading Nations in <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:206267:63"/>
               <p>But to our and the Nations great Surpriſe, and ineſtimable Loſs, while we were uſing all ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry means, and big with the hopes of riveting that Settlement upon a laſting Foundation, ſuch was the further continued Chain of unexpected Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions and moſt unaccountable Mal-treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that we met with, by Proclamations of a very ſtrange Nature, and otherwiſe, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated Misfortunes following thereupon, put us under an indiſpenſible Neceſſity of humbly peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning His Majeſty for allowing the Parliament to meet at the day appointed in <hi>November</hi> laſt; in full confidence and Expectation of having the moſt natural and cordial Aſſiſtance from thoſe who have firſt eſtabliſhed our Company, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed it Protection; eſpecially ſince all our other Applications have hitherto proved ineffectual: But a meeting of the Eſtates of Parliament at that time not quadrating (it would ſeem) with His Majeſty's other Affairs, a very conſiderable Body of the Nobility, Gentry and Burgeſſes of this Kingdom, thought fit, in a moſt dutiful and humble manner, by their late Addreſs, to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to His Majeſty, how deeply they were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the Nations concern in our Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny's repeated Misfortunes, and therefore hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly Petitioned for the ſitting of this Parliament as ſoon as conveniently might be. And the King having been moſt graciouſly pleaſed to order the Meeting of the Right Honourable Eſtates now in Parliament, We think our ſelves in all duty bound to give His Grace His Majeſty's High Commiſſioner and the Right Honourable the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, a ſhort and naked Narrative of the ſeveral Obſtructions and Misfortunes that we have been
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:206267:63"/>all along forc'd to grapple with, in the proſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Company's Deſigns, to the end that the great Council of the Nation, having a perfect View and full Knowledge of theſe Difficulties which we now Labour under, may be the better able to judge how to apply a Remedy.</p>
               <p>The firſt attempt for ſtrengthning our Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny's Intereſt and Stock was at <hi>London,</hi> where a Subſcription of 300000 <hi>ſterl.</hi> was procured in Nine days time, without ſo much as a publick Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement, and many knowing Merchants were ſo far convinc'd of the many Advantages that might probably ariſe from ſuch a Conſtitution, that they ſignified their willingneſs to be concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for Triple the Sum, if allowed: But not only did the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> by their Addreſs to His Majeſty of the 13th. of <hi>December</hi> 1695. and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therways, render that Subſcription ineffectual, but the Houſe of Commons did alſo appoint a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, <hi>to examine what Methods were taken for obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Act of Parliament, by which our ſaid Company is eſtabliſhed who were the Promoters and Adviſers thereof;</hi> and did afterwards impeach the Nominees in the ſaid Act of Parliament; notwithſtanding the abſolute Independency of this Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Yet after all this Diſcouragement, we went on with our Subſcriptions at home, and made our next Effort for ſtrengthning thereof beyond Sea, both in <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Hamburgh:</hi> In the firſt of which places many eminent Merchants declared their poſitive inclinations to be very conſiderably intereſted with us, and gave ſome ſignal Proofs thereof, till they were made to underſtand by Threatnings and other Inſinuations, that a High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Power would make them at leaſt very uneaſy,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:206267:64"/>if they perſiſted any further in their Reſolutions of being concerned with our Company,</p>
               <p>And at <hi>Hamburgh</hi> where we had the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing Hopes of foreign Aſſiſtance, the <hi>Comercii</hi> or Merchant Company, entred into Contract with our Company's Deputees, to joyn at leaſt 200000 <hi>l.Sterl.</hi> to our Company's Stock; but to our great Aſtoniſhment, His Majeſty of <hi>Great Brittains</hi> Miniſters there, did under pretence of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Warrant from the King, put a full ſtop there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, by giving in <hi>A Memorial to the Burgo-Maſters &amp; Gentlemen-Councellors of that City wholly diſ-owning the Authority of the Acts of Parliament, and Letters Patent abovemention'd, &amp; intimating that His Majeſty would regard their entring into Treaties with our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany as an Affront to his Royal Authority, and that he would not fail to reſent it, as having neither Credential Letters, nor being any otherways Authoriz'd by His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jrſty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon notice whereof, we did in all humble Duty Addreſs His Majeſty in <hi>June</hi> 1997, for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs of that open and bold Encroachment, upon not only our, but alſo the Nations Rights, in its moſt fundamental Conſtitution, by endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to ſubvert the Independency of its Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Laws, expreſly contrary to the Law of Nations: All which His Majeſty by his Royal Letter from <hi>Flanders</hi> in <hi>July</hi> 1697, <hi>Promiſed to take into Conſideration, as ſoon as he would return into</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>and that in the mean time, His Majeſty would give Orders to his Miniſters at</hi> Hamburgh, <hi>not to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct our Company in the proſecution of its Trade with the Inhabitants of that City.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the full Confidence of His Majeſty's Royal Promiſe, we thought our ſelves ſecure and took
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:206267:64"/>our Meaſures accordingly, till to our further ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, we found by ſeveral Inſtances, that His Majeſty's ſaid Miniſters were as wickedly bent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us as ever, and ſtill denying that they had got any ſuch Orders from His Majeſty: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Directors of our Company, did, by their Letter of the 28 of <hi>September</hi> 1697, expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulate in the firſt place, with both the then Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries of State, about that further Diſ-appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but having ſtill no Redreſs therein, we did in moſt humble and dutiful Manner, by our ſecond Addreſs of the 22d. day of <hi>December</hi> 1697. lay the whole Matter again before His Majeſty; And did likewiſe, at the ſame time, not only humbly Repreſent the Premiſſes to His Majeſty's moſt Honourable Privy-Council, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the train of ill Conſequences that muſt neceſſarly attend ſuch Treatment, if not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by an early Redreſs; but wrote alſo ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately to both the Secretaries of State, and ſuch other Noble Perſons of the Government, as hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd to be then at <hi>London,</hi> To uſe their Joint Intereſt, for procuring Juſtice, in a Matter of ſuch Univerſal Concern to the Honour, Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, and Independency of the whole Kingdom.</p>
               <p>All the Anſwer we obtain'd, was by a Letter of the 17th. of <hi>January</hi> 1698, from both the Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of State. <hi>That the King ſaid, He had already gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Orders to His Reſident at</hi> Hamburgh <hi>in that Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, conform to his Royal Letter from</hi> Flanders, <hi>in</hi> July 1697, <hi>which was then communicated to the Company.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By which Anſwer, together with what repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Advices we had at the ſame time from <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Miniſters there, had ſtill poſitively diſown'd their having got any ſuch
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:206267:65"/>Orders, we were put out of all Hopes of having any Redreſs, untill we ſhould have an Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of laying the whole Matter before a Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Eſtates of Parliament.</p>
               <p>But in the mean time we proceeded, with all the Strength we had (tho' extremely weak'ned by the Treatment above-narrated) to make the beſt Preparations we could (conſidering the Scarcity of theſe Years) for ſitting out an Equipage of Ships, Men, Proviſions, and other Neceſſaries, for ſettling a Plantation in <hi>America,</hi> in the Terms of the Acts of Parliament, and Letters Patent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-mention'd: And its evident by the very Conſtitutions of the Colony, that they were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated more for the general Advantage of the Nation and Poſterity, than for the particular and immediate Benefite of the Adventurers.</p>
               <p>And the Parliament happening to meet the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry next Day after our Ships had ſail'd, we did by our Humble Petition of the 22d. of <hi>July</hi> 1698, Repreſent to his Grace, His Majeſties then High Commiſſioner, and the Right Honourable Eſtates then aſſembled in Parliament, the Treatment which our Company met with at <hi>London</hi> &amp; <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hurgh</hi> as aforeſaid, the great Prejudices which we had ſuſtain'd thereby, and the many further In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies and evil Conſequences that muſt neceſſarly have followed thereupon, if, upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Account whatſoever, the Parliament ſhould happen to neglect the taking immediate Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance of ſuch Uſage.</p>
               <p>And the Parliament having thereupon, by their Unanimous Addreſs of the 5th. of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1698, to His Majeſty, thought fit to manifeſt <hi>their own and the whole Nations Concern in that Matter, earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:206267:65"/>entreating, and moſt aſſuredly expecting, That His Majeſty would in His Royal Wiſdom, take ſuch Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, as might effectually vindicate the Undoubted Rights and Priviledges of the ſaid Company, and ſupport the Credit and interest thereof;</hi> And the Parliament like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, by the ſame Addreſs, <hi>recommending the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of the ſaid Company to ſome ſpecial Marks of His Majeſties Royal Favour, as that Branch of the Trade of this Kingdom, in which they, and the Nation they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented, had a more peculiar Intereſt;</hi> The Court of Directors of our Company were thereby encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd to renew their Application to His Majeſty, with relation to the Memorial given in by His Miniſters to the Senate of <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> (the ſame being ſpecially mention'd in the Parliaments Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs:) And in Conſideration of the Dammages ſuſtain'd by the Company, through Means of that Memorial, the Directors humbly Petition'd, That His Majeſty would be pleaſed, for their Encouragement at that time, as a Gracious Mark of His Royal Favour, to beſtow upon them the two ſmalleſt of the Frigots, then (and to this Hour) lying uſeleſs in <hi>Bruntiſland</hi> Harbour.</p>
               <p>But our Company having no manner of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to either of theſe, and being aſſured by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Letters from <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> That both the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Miniſters there, had poſitively denyed their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received any ſuch Orders, as were long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore promiſed, and declared to have been given, with Relation to that Memorial, the Court of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors of our Company did, by their Letter of the 29th of <hi>November</hi> 1698, tranſmit Copies of the ſaid Letters to the Viſcount of <hi>Seafield,</hi> then ſole Secretary of State, and entreated his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, to procure ſome ſpeedy and effectual Anſwer
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:206267:66"/>from His Majeſty to the Contents of both that Letter. and their former Petition.</p>
               <p>The Secretary, by his Letter of the 13th. of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember</hi> 1698, returned for Anſwet, <hi>That he would take the first convenient Opportunity he could have, to repreſent that Matter to the King, but that he could not expect to have it for ſome time, becauſe His Majeſty was then very much imployed in the Affairs of his</hi> Engliſh <hi>Parliament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We thereupon waited a full Month in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome further Anſwer, but getting none, our Court of Directors did, by a Letter of the 13th of <hi>January</hi> 1699, put the Secretary again in mind of our ſaid Petition of the preceeding <hi>August,</hi> and Letter of the 29th of <hi>November.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Secretary by his Letter of the 7th. of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary</hi> 1699, ſignified, <hi>That he had preſented our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany's Petition to His Majesty, and was commanded to let us know, that there being Accounts, that the Ships belonging to the Company were arriv'd upon the Coaſt of</hi> America, <hi>and the particular Deſign not being commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to His Majesty, He therefore delayed to give any Anſwer, until he ſhould receive certain Information of their Settlement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tho' we could not but be ſurpriz'd to find all our former Addreſſes and Petitions, about Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of ſuch weighty Concern, as are above nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, Anſwered, after ſo long delay, only with a ſeeming Charge, for not having communicated to His Majeſty a thing that was never in the leaſt demanded of us, by either the King, Parliament, Privy Council, or Miniſters of State, we being limited to ſettle in the Terms of the Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, as we ſhould be Anſwerable: Yet upon the very firſt Advice we had of our Colony's
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:206267:66"/>Settlement in <hi>Caledonia,</hi> we by our Letters of the 31ſt. of <hi>March,</hi> and 1st. of <hi>April</hi> 1699, gave a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry full and dutiful Account thereof to His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, and to both the Secretaries of State, together with an Account of the <hi>French</hi> Deſigns thereabouts and of what Import our ſaid Settlement (if duly protected) might prove to the Intereſt and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of all His Majeſties Dominions, and refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the ſame, together with the Contents of our former Petitions, to His Majeſties Royal Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</p>
               <p>About this time it was, That His Majeſty was pleaſed to call the Preſident of the Seſſion, and the Advocat to Court, to the end (as we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood) that they, jointly with both the Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of State, might in a Conference with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Miniſters, ſatisfy His Majeſty, as to the Legality of our Company's Settlement: Which (by all that ever we could learn) was then (and otherways ſince that time) made clear beyond all manner of Diſpute.</p>
               <p>But while in the mean time, we were pawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing even our own particular Credits, for ſending the needful Supplies of Ships, Men, Proviſions, Arms, Ammunition, and other Neceſſaries, for ſecuring ſo valuable a Settlement to this Nation, we were aſtoniſhed to have Advice. That by Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders from <hi>England</hi> in <hi>January</hi> 1699, Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons had been emitted, in the Months of <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May,</hi> over all His Majeſties Plantations and Territories in <hi>America,</hi> ſtrictly Intercommuning our Colony, under very ſevere Penalties to be inflicted on the Contraveeners of theſe Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, <hi>in regard His Majesty</hi> (as theſe Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:206267:67"/>narrate) <hi>was unacquainted with the Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Deſigns of the</hi> Scots <hi>ſettling at</hi> Darien.</p>
               <p>As we humbly conſidered theſe Proclamations to be ſuch, as were never before publiſhed in thoſe parts againſt any other People upon Earth, and of ſo Barbarous a Nature, as we thought, no Good Chriſtians would put in Execution, even againſt Infidels; So finding ourſelves unqueſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably warranted by all Laws Humane and Divine, we perſiſted in our Endeavours for mantaining that Settlement, as hoping, that, through means thereof, this Nation might in time, have an Opportunity of raiſing it ſelf above the open Contempt, Reproach and Inſults of its unkind Neighbours, and of propagating the Goſpel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Ignorant good Natur'd <hi>Indians</hi> of thoſe parts.</p>
               <p>But before our Recruits could poſſibly arrive at <hi>Caledonia,</hi> our Colony got certain Accounts of theſe Proclamations, and finding at the ſame time; the ſad effects thereof, by being denied any the leaſt help, either for Goods or Money, at <hi>Jamaica,</hi> from whence they had formerly Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies; and that in the Proclamation iſſued by Sir <hi>William Beſton,</hi> Governour of that Iſland, he had poſitively declared. <hi>That by their Settlement in</hi> Darien, <hi>they had actually broken the Peace entred into with His Majeſties Allies</hi> (which they believed he durſt not veuture to have done without a ſufficient Warrant) And finding themſelves thereby to be of conſequence declared Pirates, without any previous Summons or Hearing, contrary to the Cuſtoms and common Uſage of all Nations, even in the caſe of real Piracy, and founding a Belief, at the ſame time, on the Treatment which they
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:206267:67"/>knew our Company had formerly met with in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> without being Redreſs'd therein, that we were not in a Condition either to ſupply or protect them, they unhappily took the Alarm, under ſuch a General Conſternation, as deveſted them not only of all manner of patience to ſtruggle with any Inconveniencies they lay under at the time, but alſo of all manner of prudence, in tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any reaſonable Meaſures either for their own Security, or for our Company's intereſt. In the midſt of which Conſuſion thoſe of them who had any bad Deſigns (as we could not well ſuppoſe ſuch a Number to be free of ſome) made uſe of theſe Proclamations as handies, by which to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrate their own ſeveral ends, and eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded all the reſt to leave the Settlement: Which they unadviſedly did the 20th of <hi>June</hi> laſt; And by that means not only have the Ships, Men and Goods, which were there at that time, been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the Arbitrary will of thoſe to whom the Execution of thoſe Proclamations was given in Charge, but even all our ſubſequent Meaſures brought into inevitable diſorder.</p>
               <p>Upon Information of all which, we did, by our humble Petition to His Majeſty of the 19th. of <hi>October</hi> 1699, in all humility and earneſtneſs, beg, <hi>That His Majeſty would in His Fatherly care for the good of our Company in particular, and of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in General, be graciouſly pleaſed to give ſpecial Testimonies of his Majeſty's Royal Protection to our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany at that Juncture, and particularly to take off the Force and effect of thoſe Proclamations which have been ſo prejudicial to us, and to ſignify his Royal pleaſure to the Governours of his Plantations in</hi> America, <hi>that our Colony might be ſupplied in the common and ordinary way
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:206267:68"/>of Commerce, as thoſe of other Nations are; And that in the mean time His Majesty would be graciouſly pleaſed to allow the Eſtates of Parliament to meet at the day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in</hi> November <hi>last, or as ſoon as conveniently may be, to the end that their Advice and Aſſistance might be had in ſuch a weighty and General Concern.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We likewiſe by our humble Addreſs to His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's moſt Honourable Privy Council of the 20th of <hi>October</hi> 1699. Repreſented what we thought in duty and prudence neceſſary, with relation to the Contents of our ſaid Petition to his Majeſty, <hi>Humbly referring the whole to their Lordſhips moſt ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conſideration, and praying that they would be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to do us all the good Offices with his Majeſty that they'd think moſt expedient for ſupporting our Company and Colonys Intereſt; and to give him an account of our Company's hard Circumſtances, and how much the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Intereſt of the Nation ſtood concern'd therein.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Majeſty was graciouſly pleaſed, by His Royal Letter to us of the 2d. of <hi>November</hi> 1699, to declare that <hi>He did very much regret the Loſs which the Kingdom and the Company had lately ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain'd, That he would upon all occaſions protect and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the Trade of the Nation. That he would take care that His Subjects of this Kingdom ſhould have the ſame freedom of Trade and Commerce with his</hi> Engliſh <hi>Plantations that ever they had formerly, and that he would order the Parliament to meet, when he'd judge that the Good of the Nation would require it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, in ſome ſhort time thereafter, while we were ſolacing our ſelves with the hopes of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Majeſty's protection, not only as a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany eſtabliſhed by his Royal Authority, with the Advice and Conſent of Parliament; but alſo as Subjects, making all the Preparations we could
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:206267:68"/>to ſend the needful Supplies and Advices to thoſe who were laſt ſent for Repoſſeſſing the ſame Settlement: We were further aſtoniſhed to have Advices, that, by ſecond Orders from <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> another Fleece of Proclamations had been emitted, over all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Plantations in <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> particularly on the 5th. of <hi>September</hi> laſt, in <hi>Barhados,</hi> &amp;c. And that in complyance with the intent of theſe Proclamations, Our People that went along with the <hi>Riſing-Sun,</hi> were in <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> laſt, poſitively denied Wood and Water at <hi>Monſerat,</hi> a Priviledge never before denied to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Nation: And by a Letter of the 29th of <hi>January</hi> laſt from the Commander of another of our Company's Ships, we are aſſured that they were poſitively denied Anchoring at St: <hi>Chriſtophers</hi> by the Governour, Colonel <hi>Norton,</hi> who out of his own Mouth declared to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of our ſaid Ship, That he did it by new Orders which he had received about a Month before; altho, at the ſame time, two <hi>Dutch</hi> Ships were then Watering there; which we have ſince confirmed to us by Letters from Mr. <hi>Daniel Mackay</hi> one of the Councellours of our Colony, dated at <hi>Port-Royal</hi> in <hi>Jamaica</hi> the 13th. of <hi>February</hi> laſt: By which Letters, he informs us likewiſe, That when he waited upon the Governour of that Iſland, concerning our Company's Ship the <hi>St. Andrew</hi> lying in that Harbour, The Governour declared to him, That tho the ſaid Ship were fitted for going to Sea, he would not ſuffer her to go, without a ſpecial Order from <hi>England</hi> for that Effect.</p>
               <p>We likewiſe humbly beg leave to inform Your Grace, and Right Honourable Eſtates, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:206267:69"/>our Company's many other Loſſes and Miſ-fortunes, a Ship called the <hi>Dolphin</hi> loadned with a valuable Cargo, belonging to our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, ſtruck unfortunately on a Rock, by which ſhe ſprung a Leak, and being forc'd to run a ſhore under the Walls of <hi>Carthagena,</hi> to eſcape Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack, the ſaid Ship and Goods were by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> (His Majeſty's Allies) violently ſeized and diſpoſed of as Prize, and the Men alſo to the Number of 30 and a Boy, detain'd and made cloſe Priſoners, not only contrary to the Law of Nations, (we being then in profound Peace with them) but alſo contrary to the expreſs Terms of the 10. and 11. Articles of the Treaty conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at <hi>Madrid</hi> the 2/18 Day of <hi>July</hi> 1670, between the Crowns of <hi>Great Brittain</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By our Dutiful Addreſs of the 4th. of <hi>December</hi> 1699, we humbly Petition'd His Majeſty, <hi>That He would be graciouſly pleaſed to take thoſe Proceedings of the</hi> Spaniards <hi>into His Royal Conſideration, ſo as that ſpeedy and effectual Meaſures might be taken for the Redreſs of thoſe Dammages, and the freedom of theſe diſtreſſed Priſoners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In Anſwer to which, His Majeſty was graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly pleaſed, by his Royal Letter of the 10th. of <hi>January</hi> laſt, to ſignify, <hi>That He was reſolved in the Terms of the Treaties to demand from the King of</hi> Spain, <hi>that theſe Priſoners ſhould be ſet at Liberty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet ſome of the moſt conſiderable of theſe Priſoners being tranſported above half a Year ago to Old <hi>Spain,</hi> We have frequent Advices from them by Letters, dated in <hi>Cadiz</hi>-Priſon, That they and all the Crew have been moſt Barbarouſly uſed, and that they themſelves are ſtill kept cloſe Priſoners, under very ſevere Treatment; Copies
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:206267:69"/>of which Letters we have ſome Months ago tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Secretaries of State.</p>
               <p>By all which, it cannot but evidently appear to Your Grace and Right Honourable Eſtates, that tho' we have all along us'd our beſt Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to wreſtle through theſe almoſt unſurmount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Difficulties, and exerted even our outmoſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts for retrieving our Loſſes, as much as poſſible by endeavouring to repoſſeſs and mantain ſo valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a Settlement; And tho' we have certain Advices of its being Repoſſeſs'd by our People, and that we have taken all imaginable Meaſures for their preſent Supply: Yet we have too juſt ground to be fully perſwaded, That unleſs the King and High Court of Parliament, do ſpeedily Support, Protect, and Aſſiſt us, in the Proſecution of our Company's lawful Deſigns, that all our Paſt, Preſent, and Future Endeavours muſt, to the Nation's indelible Reproach and Diſhonour, as well as to its and the Company's unſpeakable and irreparable Loſs, prove unavoidably abortive.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>May it therefore pleaſe Your Grace and Right Honourable Eſtates, to take the ſeveral Matters of Fact above-mentioned, into your moſt ſerious Conſideration; To Vindicate, Support, and Protect us in the Enjoyment of our lawful Priviledges, both as a Company, and as Subjects of this free and independent Kingdom, to take ſuch Meaſures, as You (in Your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Wiſdom) may judge moſt Effectual, for repairing the many Dammages we have
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:206267:70"/>already ſuſtain'd, and for aſſiſting us in the further Proſecution of our Company's lawful Deſigns; but more eſpecially, for the maintenance of our juſt Right and Title to the Settlement of</hi> CALEDONIA. <hi>and the Enjoyment of ſuch Advantages as (if duly Protected) may probably ariſe thereby.</hi>

                  <p>THat whereas, after a long and Expenſive War, we expected to have injoyed the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of a happily concluded Peace, by the Re-eſtabliſhing of our Forreign Trade, Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Home-Manufactures, imploying of the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:206267:70"/>Poor, in the improvement of our Native product, and the leſſening of our publick burdens:</p>
                  <p>But inſtead thereof, to the unſpeakable Loſs &amp; almoſt Ruin of the Nation, we find our Trade abroad ſenſibly decayed, and our Coin carried out, by the Importation of Commodities from places where ours are prohibited, our Woollen and other Manufactories at home, by the ſame means and the Remiſneſs of Magiſtrates, in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Laws in due Execution, receive not that Encouragement which the Intereſt of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey requires; whereby our Poor are neither mantain'd nor imploy'd, as they otherways might be, and more eſpecially our Company Trading to <hi>Africa</hi> and the <hi>Indies,</hi> meets with ſo much oppoſition from abroad, and gets ſo little ſupport at home, that after ſo great a Loſs of Men and Expenſe of Treaſure, their Sttlement in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledonia</hi> may now too probably, a ſecond time, fall under the ſame unlucky Circumſtances as at firſt if not prevented.</p>
                  <p>And yet after all theſe hardſhips that the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion groans under, numerous Forces are ſtill kept on foot, which occaſions now in time of Peace, heavy and unneceſſary Taxes, while our much wealthier Neighbours are Disbanding theirs.</p>
                  <p>All which Misfortunes and other Calamities, which have of late befallen us, we cannot but look upon as the Effects of the diſpleaſure of Almighty GOD for the Immoralities that every where abound amongſt all Ranks and Degrees of Men, to the Diſhonour of GOD and our Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Religion, the debauching the Spirits, and corrupting the manners of the People.</p>

                  <q>May it therefore pleaſe your Grace, and the Right Honourable Eſtates of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to take ſome effectual Courſe for curbing of Vice, and putting in Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the many laudable Laws for mantain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and imploying the Poor, that they may be uſeful and not burdenſome to the Kingdom; and for the Encouraging our Manufactories at home, and carrying on our Trade abroad with Advantage, to lay on ſuch Impoſitions on the Branches of our Import, as may overballance our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and particularly that of <hi>France;</hi> and to aſſert the <hi>Indian</hi> and <hi>African</hi> Company's Right to the Colony of <hi>Caledonia,</hi> which has been &amp; ſtill unjuſtly is called in queſtion, and to give ſuch ſupport to it as may Encourage the Adventurers to go on with an undertaking which, if vigorouſly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, may tend ſo much in the future to the Wealth, Honour and intereſt of the Nation, and to relieve our Countrey of a great Number of Forces, every way ſo uneaſy to the People, and in lieu thereof to fall upon ſuch other Methods for ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Peace and ſupport of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as may be more for the Intereſt of the Kingdom, and more conſiſtent with the Liberty of the Subject.</q>

We heartily wiſh that the laſt Meeting of Parliament had proceeded, ſo as that the Kingdom might have been made partakers of theſe Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages for which Our Commiſſioner was ſo fully Inſtructed: If it had been poſſible for Us to have agreed to the <hi>Reſolve</hi> offered to Aſſert the Right of the <hi>African Company's</hi> Colony in <hi>America,</hi> tho that Method had appeared to Us more unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, yet we had from the beginning readily done it, at the earneſt Deſire of Our Miniſters, and for Our Peoples Satisfaction, all other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations ſet apart. But now that Things are much changed, (wherein We are truly Sorry for the Nation's Loſs) And We being moſt wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to grant what may be needfull for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief and Eaſe of the Kingdom, and the Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of its Welfare in all its Concerns; We have thought fit to Declare this Our good Mind to be made known to all Our loving Subjects. And for the Company's Concerns, We Aſſure you, that we will be ſo ready to concurr with Our Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in every thing that can be reaſonably ex-expected of Us, for Aiding and Supporting their Intereſts, and Repairing their Loſſes, that Our good Subjects ſhall have juſt grounds to be ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of our heartie Inclinations to advance the Wealth and Proſperity of that our Ancient King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. And as for Captain <hi>Pinkerton</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Priſoners in <hi>Spain,</hi> We have already, and We hope Effectually Interpoſed for their Libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In the next place, As We did fully
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:206267:74"/>ſtruct our Commiſsioner, So we are ſtill Reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to paſs all ſuch Laws as ſhall be offered for the better Eſtabliſhing the true Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and the Presbyterian Government of the Church which you at preſent Enjoy; For the more effectual preventing the growth of Popery juſtly feared, for the Repreſsing of Vice and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morality, for the Preſerving and Securing the Liberty of Mens Perſons, for the Encouraging and Advancement of Trade and Manfactories, and generally to give Our Aſſent to ſuch other Laws as ſhall be brought in for further clearing and ſecuring Mens civil Rights and Properties, promoting the Adminiſtration of Juſtice, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Peace and Quiet of the Kingdom, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding nothing on our part, ſave what ſhall be neceſſary to mantain that our antient King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in ſo happy a Settlement againſt our &amp; their Enemies.

                        <p>Our neceſſary Abſence hath occaſioned the late Adjournments, but as ſoon as God ſhall bring Us back, We are firmly Reſolved Our Parliament ſhall Meet, where We do again Aſſure all Our good Subjects, nothing ſhall be Wanting on Our part, that may contribute to their Welfare and Happineſs.

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:206267:79"/>have attended the many Diſcouragements, and want of Protection which we labour'd under all along, have unwarrantably taken upon them the Power to ſurrender our Company's ſaid Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> to the unſpeakable Loſs and great Diſhonour of the Nation, and that the <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Proclamations, mention'd in our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Petition, being ſtill as much in force and rigorouſly executed, as ever, againſt us, we could not all this time, nor cannot as yet, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the Liberty even of carrying off our Ships, that are lying periſhing at <hi>Port-Royal</hi> in <hi>Jamaica,</hi> and <hi>Amboy-Perth</hi> in <hi>Eaſt-Jerſey</hi> without your Interpoſition on our Company's behalf, for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing to us Warrants from His Majeſty, directed to the reſpective Governours of thoſe Parts for that effect; eſpecially ſince the Governour of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica</hi> has, at ſeveral times, and to ſeveral Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, declared, That he will not part with our Company's Ship the <hi>Saint-Andrew,</hi> without a ſpecial warrant from <hi>England,</hi> and that all our Solicitations to the Secretaries of State for that end, have hitherto proved ineffectual. And we cannot but likewiſe Repreſent to your Grace and Right Honourable Eſtates, how that the want of due Protection to our Company all along, and the continued Tract of Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon its Priviledges Abroad, without any Redreſs therein, has encouraged ſome Perſons to break in upon the Priviledges of our Company even at Home.</p>
               <p>MAY it therefore Pleaſe Your Grace and Right Honourable Eſtates, to take the Contents of this, and our former Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on above-mention'd into your moſt ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:206267:80" rendition="simple:additions"/>Conſideration, to take ſuch effectual Meaſures, as in your Profound Wiſdom, you ſhall think fit, for Aſſerting and Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicating our Company's Rights, both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad and at home, for enabling it to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute its lawful Undertakings, for procur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Reparation from the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and others, for the Dammages ſuſtained, and for preventing the like Encroachments for the future.</p>
